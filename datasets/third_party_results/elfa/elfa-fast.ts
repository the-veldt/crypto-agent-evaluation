    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 7,
    result: `TL;DR:
No specific data on the highest growth in new traders over the last 4 hours is available from current sources. Zcash (ZEC) shows notable discussion of new holders replacing shaken-out buyers, while top mindshare gainers include Bitcoin (+17.60%), Solana (+12.68%), and Fartcoin (+44.74%), which may indicate rising trader interest.

---

The provided research data, including Elfa AI's token leaderboard for the 4h timeframe, tweet searches on terms like "new traders" and "new buyers," and top influencer calls, does not contain direct metrics on growth in new traders (e.g., unique wallet counts or on-chain buyer surges).

Tweets mentioning trader activity include one noting "$Z strength... alot of early buyers got shaken out and replaced by fresh/new holders in the last 24 hours" Dvcryptzz, suggesting potential new trader inflow for Zcash (ZEC), which ranks #4 on the leaderboard with a -19.32% mindshare change but recent long calls.

Elfa AI 4h Mindshare Leaders (proxy for attention/trader interest):
- Bitcoin (BTC): 28.14% mindshare, +17.60% change, 1032 mentions
- Ethereum (ETH): 13.30%, +10.85% change, 433 mentions
- Solana (SOL): 9.90%, +12.68% change, 318 mentions
- Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): 0.84%, +44.74% change, 27 mentions

These reflect mindshare growth rather than confirmed new trader metrics. Influencer calls focus on BTC, ZEC, and others but lack new trader specifics. For precise new trader data, Elfa AI may track this internally via smart accounts or on-chain analysis, but it's not in the current dataset.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 1,
    result: `TL;DR
No specific data on crypto assets with over $50k in 30-day revenue and their growth rates is available from current sources. General market news covers price movements in BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and others, but lacks protocol revenue metrics.

───

Data Limitations  
The provided research from web searches between January 1 and January 13, 2026, focuses on price rallies, geopolitical influences, ETF developments, and exchange volumes, but does not include revenue figures (e.g., fees from DEXes, L2s, or protocols) or growth comparisons for any crypto assets. No sources detail 30-day revenue exceeding $50k or percentage growth rates.

Relevant Market Context  
Recent articles highlight Bitcoin surpassing $90k-$91k, XRP gaining 20% amid rotations from BTC/ETH CNBC, and broader gains in ETH, SOL, ADA driven by risk appetite and Venezuela-related news CoinDesk. Exchange volume growth like KuCoin's $1.25tn in 2025 is noted, but this is not asset-specific revenue.

Recommendation  
For precise revenue data (e.g., from Dune Analytics, DefiLlama, or Artemis), query platforms tracking on-chain protocol fees directly, as this information is unavailable here. Elfa AI excels in social mindshare and calls, not financial revenue metrics.`

The top 3 memecoin plays on Solana are Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), and Bonk ($BONK), based on Elfa AI's current meme token leaderboard by mindshare, with $PENGU leading at 15.92% (up 16.57%) and strong bullish sentiment.

───

Leaderboard Analysis
Elfa AI's meme token leaderboard (1d timeframe) ranks Solana memecoins by mindshare and call activity. The top Solana entries show high engagement from social mentions and smart accounts:

- 1. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU): Contract 2zMMhcVQEXDtdE6vsFS7S7D5oUodfJHE8vd1gnBouauv, price $0.01256. Leads with 15.92% mindshare (+16.57%), 133 total mentions (12 smart), 56 bullish. 5 long calls (1 smart).
- 2. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Contract 9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump, price $0.39956. 12.51% mindshare (+21.47%), 104 mentions (15 smart), 51 bullish. Strongest call growth with 8 long calls (4 smart, +60%).

These stand out due to mindshare dominance, smart account interest, and bullish sentiment. Recent tweets confirm Solana meme sector momentum, including BONK's rebound (CoinMarketCap).

Other Mentions
Tokens like $TROLL (3.41% mindshare, +62.65%) and $BUTTCOIN show activity but rank lower. Trending discussions note high Solana meme volume (~24k new coins/day), though competition is fierce.

Over the last 7 days, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Zcash (ZEC), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) lead Elfa AI's mindshare leaderboard, driven by high mention volumes, smart account activity, and narratives around BTC strength, privacy coins, altcoin rotation amid falling BTC dominance, and resilient L1s like SOL.

───

Top Assets by Mindshare (Elfa AI Leaderboard, 7d)
The Elfa AI token leaderboard ranks assets by mindshare, reflecting social buzz across Crypto Twitter and Telegram. Here are the standout tokens:

- Bitcoin (BTC): 20.85% mindshare (34,180 total mentions, 4,701 smart); bullish sentiment dominates at 43% of mentions. Long calls total 1,333 (284 smart), signaling sustained interest despite a 5.68% mindshare dip.
- Ethereum (ETH): 11.61% mindshare (14,874 mentions); steady but down 2.87%, with 271 long calls amid rotation talks.
- Solana (SOL): 9.96% mindshare, up sharply 20.27% (12,981 mentions); RWA tokenization and ETF narratives boost bullish chatter (53% positive sentiment).

Lower ranks include XRP (1.76%), BNB (1.65%), LIT (1.53%, +323% mindshare surge), PUMP (1.19%), and ARB (1.17%).

Key Narratives Driving Discussion
Altcoin rotation: Multiple sources highlight altcoins capturing ~50% of trading volume (vs BTC 27%, ETH 23%), with BTC dominance breaking down—echoing 2021 patterns. NekozTek, coinbureau.

Memecoins and hype: PEPE, BONK, FARTCOIN, PENGU, and emerging plays like BAOBAO trend via community pumps; TheChartArtist, AltcoinSherpa calls FARTCOIN bottoming.

Privacy and niche: ZEC rises in LunarCrush AltRank; strategy tokens and BTC-native assets like DOG also noted as "interesting." LunarCrush.

Exchange hotspots: WEEX promotes PIPPIN, IP, WLFI, ZKP as daily hot coins, reflecting short-term pumps.

Influencer Calls (Top Smart Accounts, Recent)
Smart accounts push longs on BTC (BobLoukas), ZEC, HYPE, FARTCOIN (AltcoinSherpa), FLUID, and memes like PENGU (CryptoKaleo). Sentiment leans bullish on dips, with caution on ETH retests.

    query: "what are the most trending crypto consumer products and why",
    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 14,
    result: `TL;DR:
No specific crypto consumer products are dominating the Elfa AI token leaderboard or showing standout mindshare among the top trending tokens like BTC, ETH, SOL, or ZEC. Social discussions highlight broader interest in consumer DeFi apps (e.g., neobanks, yield-earning payments via @useTria), payments infrastructure (Stripe, Visa, Mastercard expansions), and chains like Aptos, Solana, Sei for consumer use cases, driven by seamless UX, gasless transactions, and real user activity beyond trading.

───

Trending Themes in Crypto Consumer Products
Current trends focus on consumer-facing applications that embed blockchain for payments, yield, and everyday utility without exposing crypto complexity. Tweets emphasize "consumer DeFi" like mobile apps for spending crypto on credit cards while earning yield (@AzFlin), and chains enabling this such as Aptos (high L1 active users from consumer apps) (@Tom_Degen68) and Solana for asset ownership in gaming/fantasy sports (@DegenMack). Web searches point to payments growth, with Stripe onboarding crypto-native payments for enterprises and traditional processors like Visa/Mastercard deploying blockchain rails (Forbes).

Reasons for Popularity
- UX Improvements: Discussions stress hiding blockchain friction (chains, gas, bridges) to mimic Web2 apps, boosting retention from <15% to Web2 levels (40-50%) (@0x0simba_eth). Products succeed by prioritizing outcomes like instant transfers over education.
- Real Adoption Metrics: Chains like Sei (1.5M+ daily active addresses, +100% in 4 months) and Aptos (#5 L1 users) show sustained activity from payments, gaming, stablecoins—not just speculation (@SeiNetwork).
- Enablement Layers: DeFi as backend for consumer apps (e.g., Boba Network's hybrid L2, Flow's x402 pay-per-request) supports gasless txs and native payments (@bobanetwork, @thirdweb).

Elfa AI Leaderboard Context
Top tokens (7-day data) are infrastructure-heavy: BTC (20.85% mindshare), ETH (11.61%), SOL (9.96%, +20% change). No pure consumer apps rank highly, indicating the narrative is emerging via discussions rather than token pumps. ZEC (+160% mindshare) sees privacy-driven calls, potentially tying to consumer payments.

    result: `TL;DR:
Lighter (LIT) and Pump (PUMP) stand out as the most promising small-to-mid cap projects based on quant metrics from Elfa AI leaderboards, showing top mindshare (4.16% and 2.13%), explosive growth (+55.90% and +59.18%), smart mentions, and bullish calls with favorable technical reversal setups noted in recent smart account analysis.

───

Quant Metrics Overview
Analysis draws from Elfa AI token leaderboards (top mindshare and mindshare change, excluding majors, past 24h as of 2026-01-13). Focus is on small-to-mid cap proxies: market caps implied by prices (~$2-900 range, excluding microcaps <0.01 with low liquidity) and tokens with smart account engagement, bullish sentiment >50%, long calls, and mindshare momentum. Top candidates filter for these plus cross-referenced smart calls and technical notes.

Lighter (LIT): 0x232ce3bd40fcd6f80f3d55a522d03f25df784ee2 (ETH, $2.17 price). #1 mindshare at 4.16% (+55.90%), 385 total mentions (56 smart), bullish sentiment dominant (93/385). 10 long calls (1 smart), indicating growing conviction.

Pump (PUMP): pumpCmXqMfrsAkQ5r49WcJnRayYRqmXz6ae8H7H9Dfn (Solana, $0.002617). 2.13% mindshare (+59.18%), 199 mentions (42 smart), bullish/neutral tilt. 11 long calls (2 smart, +120%), strong reversal signal from CryptoGodJohn at potential bottom post-reclaim of $0.0027.

Hyperliquid (HYPE): 0x0d01dc56dcaaca66ad901c959b4011ec (Hyperliquid, $24.7). #2 mindshare 4.09% (+13.45%), 368 mentions (52 smart), highly bullish (118/368). 16 long calls (6 smart), bottom call from trader1sz.

Technical Setups
Limited chart data available, but smart tweets highlight reversal/accumulation:
- $PUMP: Bottomed with Alan return; reclaim $0.0027 targets bounce CryptoGodJohn.
- $HYPE: Bottom confirmed, poised for upside trader1sz.
- Broader alts like $PIN show relative strength breakout from 5-month downtrend (small cap AI/DeFi/RWA) CryptoBullet1, but lacks leaderboard quant backing.

No direct chart access for these; setups inferred from calls and sentiment.

Catalysts and Narrative Sustainability
- LIT: High smart engagement suggests emerging narrative (trading/infra?); +56% mindshare growth indicates early momentum with sustainability via 93 bullish mentions vs 82 bearish.
- PUMP: Pump.fun ecosystem ties to Solana launchpads; narrative sustained by 42 smart mentions and call surge, low price enables viral potential.
- HYPE: Hyperliquid chain activity; strong bullish skew (low bearish 22/368) supports persistence amid L1 competition.
- $FLUID (0x6f40d4a6237c257fff2db00fa0510deeecd303eb, $3.26): Explosive +524% mindshare change, #2 DEX on ETH, v2 launch mid-Feb, Jup Lend/VenusX catalysts litocoen; sustainable DeFi narrative.
- $BNB: Chain fees overtook Solana ($1.2M/24h), PancakeSwap activity NekozTek; mid-cap L1 kingpin.

Recommendation
Prioritize LIT for balanced quant strength (mindshare + calls) and PUMP for momentum/reversal upside. Research on-chain volume, liquidity next. Risk: High volatility in alts; BTC dominance may cap gains. NFA/DYOR.`

    speed: 2,
    result: `TL;DR
No specific crypto projects raising over $1M+ in VC or traditional funding were identified in the last 30 days (Dec 14, 2025–Jan 13, 2026) from available web search results. VC fundraising activity has been low overall, dominated by large VC firms like Andreessen Horowitz ($15B across new funds) rather than individual crypto startups. GeeFi ($GEE) reported ~$900K in presale inflows by Dec 19, 2025, but this falls below "over" thresholds and is presale, not VC.

───

Overview of Recent Funding Landscape
Web search results highlight a sluggish VC market in late 2025–early 2026, with U.S. firms raising just $66.1B in 2025 (down from $101.3B in 2024), per preliminary PitchBook/NVCA data Axios. Crypto-specific raises for projects were not prominently featured, with coverage focusing on VC firms securing capital (e.g., a16z's $6.75B growth fund) or broader fintech trends.

Notable Mentions
- GeeFi ($GEE): Secured nearly $900K in token presale inflows over two weeks by Dec 19, 2025 (~24M tokens sold), signaling DeFi interest but not VC funding Business Insider.
- Coinbax: Recent fintech funding round (amount unspecified) from industry leaders in banking/payments/digital assets, aimed at engineering expansion FinTech Futures.
- Onsetto: $2.2M seed led by EJF Ventures (builds on prior $550K seed), but primarily fintech-focused FinTech Futures.

Data Limitations
No comprehensive lists or trackers (e.g., from CryptoRank, Messari) appeared in top results for high-value crypto project raises in the queried period. Activity may be underreported, shifted to presales/ICOs, or overshadowed by IPO momentum (e.g., Bullish, Circle) and macro VC trends PitchBook.

Bullish Catalysts

Memecoin Trenches Revival: Community activity shows a resurgence in Solana memecoin launches and trading (e.g., $WHITEWHALE, $TESTICLE, BobStreamer), increasing transactions, liquidity demand, and fee capture— a short-term driver for SOL demand. Tradinator33, Zenia_sol.

2026 Global Hackathon Dates: Superteam announced Solana hackathons for Apr 6–May 11 and Sep 28–Nov 2, expected to accelerate developer onboarding and dApp launches for long-term network growth. superteam.

Whale Accumulation: A major whale holds a $73.5M SOL long position as part of an $800M+ book across ETH/BTC/SOL, creating buying pressure but with liquidation risks. arkham, TedPillows.

Jupiter DeFi Momentum: Jupiter Lend hit $1B TVL in ~8 days; Jupiter Mobile offers 0% swap fees, driving DeFi liquidity and swap volume. aixbt_agent, FabianoSolana.

Helius-IntoDotSpace Integration: Helius Labs enables real-time RPCs and data streaming for Solana apps like trading platforms, enhancing scalability and UX. pukerrainbrow.

Price and Market Context
SOL trades at $143.38 (down 0.02% 24h, up 3.2% 7d), with no major bearish Solana-specific catalysts in recent data. Broader market shifts (e.g., capital flowing to BTC/ETH) add macro pressure. Elfa token data.

Pendle trades at $2.22 with a $375M market cap and exceptional 0.1x MCAP/TVL ratio against $3.83B TVL, reflecting deep undervaluation relative to its yield tokenization dominance and $43.6M 2025 gross profits exceeding emissions. Recent bullish catalysts (Grayscale consideration, UX upgrades, new pools, elevated PT yields) signal upside potential to $5–7 (2–3x) if TVL growth and institutional flows materialize, though macro risks and competition remain.

───

Overview
Pendle is a leading DeFi protocol for tokenizing and trading future yield via Principal Tokens (PTs) and Yield Tokens (YTs), deployed across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Base, Sonic, Berachain, and HyperEVM ecosystems.

Recent Developments and Catalysts
Multiple bullish signals emerged in early 2026:
- Grayscale Consideration: PENDLE listed in Grayscale's Q1 2026 "Assets Under Consideration" (Financials category), signaling potential institutional product exposure.
- Yield Opportunities: PT-jrUSDe/PT-USDe yield ~11% APY; PT-sNUSD (13.95%) loopable on Morpho; third-party demand from Strata/Lista.
- Product Upgrades: V2 new pools (e.g., PT-sNUSD, PlasmaUSD); UI improvements (PT/YT separation, maturity viz); "Scale Order" limit orders for low-fee PT/YT buys.
- Ecosystem: Penpie boosts vePENDLE yields; integrations like SuperVaults and Boros enhance capital efficiency.

These factors drive on-chain activity, fee capture, and token demand without direct emissions reliance.

Valuation Analysis
Pendle's 0.1x MCAP/TVL is exceptionally low vs. DeFi peers (e.g., Uniswap ~1x, Aave ~0.5x), implying undervaluation given its unique yield trading moat and profitability. At $3.83B TVL, protocol revenue potential supports $1B+ FDV at 0.3x MCAP/TVL normalization. 2025's $43.6M profits suggest sustainable economics, bolstered by vePENDLE emissions.

Comparables:
- Similar yield/DeFi protocols trade at 0.3–0.8x MCAP/TVL.
- Grayscale inclusion could mirror ENA/JUP inflows, targeting 2–3x re-rating.

Risks: Yield market cyclicality, competition (e.g., new fixed-income protocols), macro tightening, or TVL outflows could pressure multiples. No 2026 price targets found in recent web/tweet searches.

Investment Thesis
Bullish at current levels. Undervalued vs. fundamentals; catalysts position PENDLE for re-rating to $5–7 (MCAP $1–1.5B) on TVL stability and Grayscale flows. Accumulate on dips below $2.10; monitor TVL and vePENDLE locks for confirmation. Trade cautiously with stops, given -35% 200d drawdown.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 5,
    result: `TL;DR:
Hyperliquid leads perp DEXs with ~20% volume share and ~50% OI share as of Jan 2026, ahead of rivals like Lighter, edgeX, and Paradex; key moats include its optimized L1 for high performance and consistent $2M daily revenue funding buybacks, while catalysts feature Grayscale consideration, equities integration via partners like Extended, and rising adoption in commodities/NFTs—positioning it as the 2026 frontrunner despite competition.

───

Market Landscape
The perp DEX sector is highly competitive in 2026, with Hyperliquid maintaining dominance at over 20% of perp volume market share (up from recent lows) and nearly 50% open interest share, per recent metrics. (patfscott) Challengers include Lighter (#2), edgeX (#4, $91B 30D volume), Paradex (#7, $30.2B), Extended (#8, $29.3B), Pacifica (#9), GRVT (#6), and others like Ostium, Reya, and Nado, many pre-TGE and focused on niches such as TradFi assets, privacy, or specific L2s (e.g., Starknet, Solana). (BlockFlow_News) dYdX emphasizes incentives like 50% fee rebates and spot expansion (including U.S. Solana access), while GMX remains relevant but trails in volume rankings. (dYdX Analyst Call) Hyperliquid's edge persists post-airdrop farming dilution, with predictions it will end 2026 as "#1 perp DEX." (Delphi_Digital)

Key Moats
Hyperliquid's primary moats stem from its custom L1 blockchain, delivering CEX-level speed, low latency, and scalability without reliance on congested L2s—enabling features like portfolio margin and native markets for CEX parity. Consistent ~$2M daily revenue (even sans volatility/incentives) drives HYPE buybacks, reducing supply and supporting price stability. (Crypto_McKenna) Superior execution (e.g., Extended generating 4x fees vs. rivals on HYPE) and network effects from high OI/user base deter switchers. TVL stands at $4.5B with $5.9B market cap (1.3 MCAP/TVL ratio), underscoring efficiency. Unlike appchain rivals (e.g., dYdX on Cosmos) or L2-based (e.g., GMX on Arbitrum), Hyperliquid's vertical integration optimizes for perps from the ground up.

Catalysts
Bullish signals include Grayscale evaluating HYPE for investment products, potentially unlocking institutional inflows. (PushpendraTech) Extended's $235K daily fees (4x rivals) and upcoming equities integration (possibly eToro) signal TradFi orderflow. (cyberxtremog) Adoption grows with $86M commodity volume (e.g., $SILVER) and first on-chain NFT (TinyHypercats). (esprisi0; bluegwei) HIP-3 scaling, USDC leak fixes, and volatility-driven OI highs loom large. (Crypto_McKenna) HYPE trades at $24.56 (+3.78% 24h, -9% 7d), with neutral tokenomics tweak via Kinetiq's $5M bounty/25% airdrop boosting security. (wassielawyer) Risks: Rising forks (Aster, Lighter) and pre-TGE volume grabbers could erode share if Hyperliquid lags innovation.`

    result: `TL;DR:
Among memecoins with the highest 7-day mindshare growth, BUTTCOIN and SHREK stand out for best catalysts and narrative sustainability—BUTTCOIN with its "next Bitcoin" parody backed by high bullish mentions (92/133), and SHREK with explosive 5958% growth plus strong bullish sentiment (46/55)—while others like MOODENG show solid momentum but limited specific catalysts in current data.

───

Leaderboard Overview
The Elfa AI token leaderboard for memecoins, sorted by 7-day mindshare change, highlights top performers. Key metrics include mindshare growth, mention sentiment, and calls. Limited tweet data on catalysts reduces depth, but narratives emerge from mentions.

Top 5 by mindshare growth:
- SHREK (ETH, 0x77f6e975aa520601236f61c81ca8a88e2c3cc1a9): 5958% change to 1.01% mindshare; 55 mentions (7 smart, 46 bullish).
- RUNNER (Base): 1337% change to 0.24%; 12 mentions (9 bullish).
- UP (Solana): 1122% change to 0.20%; 10 mentions (1 smart, 8 bullish).
- BUTTCOIN (Solana, FasH397CeZLNYWkd3wWK9vrmjd1z93n3b59DssRXpump): 999% change to 1.68%; 133 mentions (92 bullish, 10 long calls).
- COPE (Solana): 948% change to 0.35%; 17 mentions (3 smart).

Catalysts and Narrative Assessment
Catalysts refer to emerging drivers like unique narratives or community momentum; sustainability gauges durability beyond hype.

- BUTTCOIN: Strongest catalyst via "biggest memecoin ever" parody narrative, tying into Bitcoin themes with high volume (133 mentions, mostly bullish). 10 long calls add credibility. High mindshare (1.68%) suggests sustainability if parody holds amid BTC cycles. SpoiledBySpoily.
- SHREK: Massive growth implies viral cultural narrative (e.g., movie/collectible tie-ins), fully bullish sentiment, and smart mentions. Lacks explicit tweet catalysts but top rank signals momentum; sustainability via broad appeal.
- MOODENG (701% growth): Animal meme resilience (62 mentions, 30 bullish), one call. Narrative durable like prior hippo memes, but neutral-heavy sentiment tempers upside. hackernoon notes similar memecoin patterns.

Others (e.g., RUNNER, UP, COPE) show growth but neutral sentiment and no clear catalysts in tweets, limiting sustainability potential.

Trading Considerations
Prioritize BUTTCOIN for narrative edge and volume; monitor SHREK for breakout. Data shows no short calls, bullish tilt, but memecoins remain high-risk—mindshare spikes can fade without sustained catalysts. No private roadmap or future plans available.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 9,
    result: `TL;DR
Jito (JTO) has a total and max supply of 1 billion tokens, with ~424 million circulating as of January 2026 (42% of total). JTO is the governance token for the Jito Network on Solana, used for voting on proposals like JIP-31/32; detailed allocation, vesting, emission, or fee-share mechanics are not available in current data.

───

Token Supply and Market Data  
JTO's total supply is 1,000,000,000 tokens, which equals its max supply (no inflation). Circulating supply stands at 423,766,015 JTO. Current price is ~$0.45 USD, yielding a market cap of ~$189M and fully diluted valuation (FDV) of ~$447M (MC/FDV ratio: 0.42). Jito has $2.07B TVL, giving an MC/TVL ratio of 0.09. Token contract on Solana: jtojtomepa8beP8AuQc6eXt5FriJwfFMwQx2v2f9mCL (Jito Network).

Utility and Governance  
JTO serves as the governance token for Jito Network, a Solana liquid staking and MEV infrastructure protocol. Holders vote on Jito Improvement Proposals (JIPs), such as JIP-31 (activates BAM Early-Adopter Subsidy, directing 100% protocol revenue to the BAM staking pool) and JIP-32 (launches Season Two of Community subDAO for expansion), both recently passed unanimously (@jito_sol). No specific staking rewards, fee-sharing, or burn mechanics for JTO are detailed in available data.

Limitations on Allocation and Vesting  
Current research yields no specifics on initial allocation breakdown (e.g., team, investors, community), vesting schedules, or emission curves. Web searches and recent tweets focus on market performance, governance votes, and integrations rather than tokenomics origins. For comprehensive details, refer to Jito's official docs at jito.network or on-chain explorers like Solscan.`

Data from Elfa AI leaderboard (7d timeframe).

Fundamentals Comparison
Ethereum dominates as the mature smart contract platform with unmatched developer ecosystem (44k+ GitHub stars, 41 commits/4wks) and institutional adoption. Key strengths include RWA tokenization hitting critical mass (Ondo: 40%+ issuance, 200+ stocks/ETFs OndoFinance) and staking treasury growth (SharpLink: +500 ETH weekly to 11,157 ETH total SharpLink). However, high fees drive outflows to L1s like SOL/Tron for NFTs/minting (250-NFT Monad batch: $0.000075 vs ETH ~$400-800 HodlerPete).

Solana excels in speed/cost for high-throughput apps, powering memecoin revivals (e.g., $WHITEWHALE, $TESTICLE), DeFi milestones (Jupiter Lend: $1B TVL in 8 days aixbt_agent), and infra upgrades (Helius RPCs for IntoDotSpace pukerrainbrow). 2026 hackathons (Apr-May, Sep-Nov superteam) signal developer influx. Recent perp volumes surpassed ETH ($1.46B vs $1.33B CryptoCurb).

Social Sentiment and Catalysts
SOL shows bullish momentum: whale longs ($73.5M TedPillows), memecoin trenches boosting txns/fees, 0% Jupiter Mobile swaps. Community views SOL beating ETH on tokenized stocks/cost (e.g., $50 vs near-free BrianneFrey). Bearish note: Network outages history (not recent).

ETH has whale support ($647M long, same entity) and upgrades (ETHGas GWEI token/TGE for realtime txns WuBlockchain), but bearish signals include capital rotation to SOL (volumes picking up EmsleyJonnie) and ETF outflows (SOL +$32.8M inflows SolanaFloor).

Risks and Investment Thesis
- SOL Bull Case: High-beta play on retail/DeFi growth; overweight for 2026 upside if memecoins/hackathons sustain activity. Risks: Centralization, volatility from outages/whales.
- ETH Bull Case: Defensive store-of-value with L1 moat; hold core position for RWA/staking yields. Risks: Competition eroding fees, slower innovation.
- Portfolio Allocation: 60/40 ETH/SOL for balance; pure growth → overweight SOL given mindshare edge and recent outperformance (SOL set to beat ETH post-Apr 2025 greenytrades). Monitor SOL/ETH pair for relative strength.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 31,
    result: `TL;DR:
Limited specific data on tokenomics, moats, and market share for token launchpads; general 2026 trends highlight ICO and meme launchpads as top narratives per CoinGecko, with emerging projects like HuddlePad (Arbitrum-native CCA model reducing sniping) and Virtual Protocol ($VIRTUAL AI launchpad with 16k+ launches) showing buzz for growth via fair mechanisms and AI integration—watch these for potential share gains amid narrative revival.

───

Market Landscape
Token launchpads are resurfacing as a key 2026 narrative, listed by CoinGecko among the top 9 crypto trends alongside memes, prediction markets, and RWAs, signaling a shift back to ICO-style launches but with improved mechanics. Tweets from smart accounts emphasize a crowded, fragmented space where launchpads dominate memecoin and AI project deployments on chains like Solana (e.g., Pump.fun's influence) and Arbitrum. Criticism exists around over-reliance on launchpads diluting focus from narratives and teams, yet demand persists for fairer models amid sniping issues.

Key Projects and Tokenomics
Data lacks detailed tokenomics breakdowns (supply, vesting, emissions) for most launchpads. Emerging ones include:
- HuddlePad (@huddle01com): Arbitrum-native using Uniswap's Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA) for transparent pricing, instant liquidity, and reduced front-running/sniping; smart accounts praise it as a "healthy ICO revival."
- Virtual Protocol ($VIRTUAL, Base chain, price ~$1.00): AI-focused launchpad with 16,000+ launches; 2026 roadmap emphasizes robotics and new models (Pegasus, Unicorn, Titan); ranks #8 on Elfa DeFi leaderboard with 3.17% mindshare.
- Others like $SERV (permissionless launches upcoming), PimpFun ($PIMP, Solana with dividends/buybacks/burns), and AOL (USD1-focused) gain mentions but without tokenomics specifics.

No comprehensive moats data; inferred strengths are chain-native integration (e.g., HuddlePad on Arbitrum), AI/niche focus (Virtual), and anti-bot features (CCA).

Projects Poised for Growth
HuddlePad and Virtual Protocol stand out for market share potential:
- HuddlePad: Fair launch mechanics address core pain points (bots, fake demand), backed by Arbitrum ecosystem promo; could capture ICO narrative share.
- Virtual Protocol: Proven volume (16k launches), AI agent synergy ($70M+ stablecoins managed), and roadmap momentum position it for AI/crypto hype.

Growth drivers include narrative tailwinds (CoinGecko rankings), technical innovations (CCA), and chain-specific adoption (Solana/Base/Arbitrum). Limited data prevents deeper quantitative assessment; monitor social mindshare for shifts.`

No specific data on the top 5 crypto projects by revenue growth or their catalysts is available from current sources, including token leaderboards (sorted by mindshare), web searches, or smart account tweets. Leaderboard focuses on mindshare metrics like BTC (20.86%), ETH (11.61%), SOL (9.94%), with no revenue rankings provided.

───

Available Insights on Revenue Mentions  
Recent smart account tweets highlight isolated protocol revenue growth but lack comprehensive rankings or growth rates across projects. For example:  
- Maple Finance ($SYRUP): Reported $30M ARR based on December 2025 revenues, with 25% allocated to buybacks; positioned for strong growth (Crypto_McKenna).  
- Neverland (on Monad): Top revenue gainer at $15,901 weekly, driven by veDUST incentives and self-repaying loans; TVL up 38% (FishMarketAcad).  
- Boros_fi (with Pendle): Volume growth to $4.7B OI, fee/revenue surge as a catalyst (cryptovishal7).  

These are anecdotal from Monad ecosystem recaps and DeFi discussions, not a ranked top 5 by growth.

Data Limitations  
Token leaderboard data emphasizes 7-day mindshare and calls, not revenue or fees (e.g., SOL mindshare +19.83%, ZEC +160.35%). Web results cover presales (Mutuum Finance, GeeFi) and unrelated topics, with no protocol revenue growth rankings. Without dedicated revenue metrics, a precise top 5 cannot be determined.`

    result: `TL;DR:
Top revenue-generating Solana projects include Pump.fun (leading DEX/launchpad), Jupiter (aggregator), Raydium (AMM), ORE Protocol (3rd in protocol revenue with low 1.9x MC/revenue valuation), Kamino (lending), and Phantom wallet (top-15 cross-chain), driven by Solana's 2025 app revenue surge to $2.3-2.39B from memecoin frenzy, stablecoin growth to $15B MC, and DEX dominance.

───

Overview of Solana's Revenue Landscape
Solana apps generated $2.3-2.39 billion in revenue across 2025, outpacing other chains like Hyperliquid and Ethereum, with the network reclaiming #1 in weekly revenue by early 2026 and leading DEX volume/app revenue for multiple days. (cryptorand) This positions Solana as the top chain by 2025 revenue at ~$1.3B, fueled by memecoin activity (e.g., Bonk +50%), stablecoin market tripling to $15B, and high app fees. (cryptonews) (solananew)

Key Top Revenue Projects and Catalysts
- Pump.fun: Tops Solana ecosystem revenue as a memecoin launchpad/DEX, benefiting from the memecoin frenzy driving network activity; listed #1 in annualized revenue dashboards. (viktorfischer) Catalyst: Viral memecoin launches amid Solana's DEX volume leadership.

- Jupiter: Aggregator generating significant fees (top-15 cross-chain), leveraging Solana's stack for swaps; high TVL and integrations boost usage. (AustinBarack) Catalyst: Dominant DEX routing in high-volume environment.

- Raydium: Core AMM protocol with consistent revenue from swaps; ranks high in 30-day metrics despite mindshare dip (-22.76%). Leaderboard rank #6. Catalyst: Central liquidity hub for Solana DeFi trading.

- ORE Protocol: 3rd highest revenue protocol on Solana with attractive 1.9x market cap/revenue ratio; top-15 cross-chain. (viktorfischer) (AustinBarack) Catalyst: Efficient fee capture from protocol activity.

- Kamino: Lending protocol in top revenue lists; mindshare up 20.87% with bullish sentiment. Leaderboard rank #9. Catalyst: Growing DeFi lending demand on Solana.

- Phantom: Wallet extracting app revenue (top-15 cross-chain) via integrations and fees. (AustinBarack) Catalyst: User onboarding for memecoin/stablecoin trading.

Comparative Insights
Pump.fun and Jupiter lead due to direct DEX/meme exposure, while Raydium/ORE excel on low valuations/higher efficiency. Solana protocols benefit ecosystem-wide from $15B stablecoins and #1 DEX/app revenue streaks, but face competition from Hyperliquid/Tron. Mindshare leaders like Raydium/Jupiter/Kamino show mixed growth, with AVICI (rank #3) pumping on calls (+233%) but unclear revenue tie. No direct 7d revenue rankings available beyond ecosystem aggregates.

    result: `TL;DR
No specific P/S ratios or direct rankings for DeFi protocols are available in current data. Top DeFi tokens by mindshare include AAVE, UNI, MORPHO, and PENDLE, with tweets noting concentrated revenue among a few protocols, but valuation metrics like P/S require dedicated analytics platforms like DeFi Llama (mentioned in recent discussions).

───

Current research data from web searches, tweets, and Elfa AI's DeFi token leaderboard does not provide explicit price-to-sales (P/S) ratios or rankings for DeFi protocols. P/S valuation typically compares a protocol's market cap to its annualized revenue (e.g., fees captured), but no sources here deliver computed figures.

Tweets highlight general DeFi revenue trends, such as "the vast majority of DeFi revenue going to token holders today comes from just a few protocols" (@patfscott), suggesting concentration but without quantifying P/S. Other discussions touch on revenue generation in protocols like Curve and GMX, yet emphasize macro factors over valuations.

Elfa AI's DeFi leaderboard ranks tokens by mindshare (not P/S), with leaders like AAVE (12.54% mindshare, price $172.64), UNI (12.12%, $5.58), MORPHO (8.98%, $1.34), and PENDLE (8.84%, $2.21). These indicate current buzz among smart accounts but do not reflect revenue-based valuations.

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 6,
    result: `TL;DR:
Bitcoin remains the leading crypto narrative/meta as the maturing macro asset amid institutional adoption and policy shifts, driving 24% mindshare with strong smart account bullish sentiment (BTC at $93k); key assets are BTC, ETH, SOL; emerging rotations into privacy (ZEC, XMR) and payments (XRP) show momentum, but majors dominate leaderboards and calls. TAM is multi-trillion via global finance integration; sustainability hinges on macro liquidity; moat lies in network effects and liquidity.

───

Leading Narrative/Meta: Bitcoin as Maturing Macro Asset
Bitcoin leads with 23.97% mindshare (5,074 mentions, 805 smart), down 10% but still dominant per Elfa AI leaderboard (timeframe: 1d). Smart sentiment skews bullish (2,294 vs. 133 bearish), with 225 long calls (58 smart) vs. 30 shorts. Influencers like Ansem push $100k targets via buy pressure, while Bob Loukas eyes $107k despite weakness. Fidelity frames BTC as maturing into a macro asset shaped by liquidity, institutions, and policy—absorbing shocks but risk-off vulnerable.

ETH (11.94% mindshare, up 3.91%) and SOL (10.80%, up 16.78%) trail as L1 plays, with bullish sentiment but fewer calls. Tweets highlight narrative fragmentation: privacy (XMR ATH $680), payments (XRP +20% rotation), stablecoins, RWAs, perps—but no unified alt meta overtakes BTC dominance.

Assets Driving the Narrative
- BTC: Core driver; top long calls from smart accounts like Ansem, Bob Loukas, CryptoKaleo.
- ETH/SOL: Ecosystem plays; SOL up 17% mindshare on momentum.
- Emerging: XRP (payments rally per CNBC); ZEC (1.82% mindshare, privacy push); HYPE/LIT (perps/DEX, 2%+ mindshare with smart longs like TraderSZ); memes (FARTCOIN, PENGU calls).

Top influence calls reinforce majors: 60%+ BTC-focused longs.

TAM Analysis
BTC macro narrative taps multi-trillion TAM via institutional replatforming: ETFs/DATCos, nation-state reserves (Gemini trends), payments (Stripe/Visa expansions, $38B illegal casino hint per Forbes). Privacy/RWAs add $1T+ via surveillance resistance and tokenization. Perps/stablecoins target $100T+ derivatives/FX. 2025 IPO wave (Circle, Kraken) signals pro maturation (PitchBook).

Sustainability
Moderate-high: BTC's deep liquidity weathers risk-off (Fidelity bull/bear cases), but alts/memes vulnerable to BTC correlation. Policy tailwinds (SEC deprioritizes crypto, bipartisan US per tweets) aid, but volatility risks 401ks (CNBC Warren). Privacy/payments sustainable if regulation tightens surveillance; memes low sustainability.

Moat Characteristics
BTC/ETH/SOL: Unrivaled network effects, liquidity, institutional flows—first-mover + HODL culture. Privacy (ZEC/XMR): Tech moat in ZK/proofs amid rising surveillance. Payments (XRP): Cross-border speed/cost vs. TradFi rails. Perps (HYPE): Onchain CEX-like execution. Weak moats in memes (hype-dependent). Overall, majors' embedded finance integration (ETFs, cards) creates defensible scale vs. fragmented alts.`

    result: `TL;DR:
Top 24h gainers with ≥$20M market cap include $DASH (+60-66%), $IP (+30%), and $XMR (+13-18%), all driven by the privacy coin narrative resurgence amid tightening surveillance, regulation, and demand for anonymous assets—privacy emerges as the central sector with catalysts like technical breakouts and altcoin rotation.

───

Top Gainers (≥$20M Market Cap, Last 24h)
Based on aggregated data from social mentions and reports, the leading tokens with confirmed market caps above $20M and strongest 24h price growth are:

- $DASH (Dash): +60-66%, MC ~$1B+ (privacy-focused coin). KuCoin, AltCryptoGems, CPOfficialtx
- $IP (Story Protocol): +30%, MC sufficient per listings. Decrypt, AltCryptoGems
- $XMR (Monero): +13-18%, MC $10.5-11.7B, hit new ATH ~$636-680. Decrypt, stacy_muur, TokenHunter

Smaller mentions like $DOLO (+57-70%), $PLAY (+53%), and $ZEC (+7%) appear in gainers lists but lack explicit ≥$20M MC confirmation in data; $CHZ and $MYX also noted but lower gains.

Common Themes and Narratives
Privacy coins dominate as the unifying sector, with $DASH, $XMR, and related $ZEC leading gains. Narratives center on "privacy resurgence" as a necessity amid global surveillance tightening (e.g., Dubai DIFC ban on privacy tokens) and regulatory expansion. catchingflaws, CPOfficialtx

Key drivers:
- Demand for anonymity: Gold at $4,600/oz, US political tensions (e.g., Trump vs. Fed), and capital flight to uncensorable assets. stacy_muur
- Technical momentum: $XMR broke 8-year ATH ($517), triggering FOMO; RSI overbought at 88, Fib targets $601-656. stacy_muur
- Altcoin rotation: Capital shifting from BTC/ETH to alts/privacy amid maturing majors and liquidity concentration. kyledoops

Catalysts Analysis
Central sector: Privacy coins. Catalysts include:
- Macro tailwinds: Escalating policy risks boost "private money" repricing; privacy leads weekly sector performance.
- On-chain/volume surge: $XMR 24h volume +230% to $338M, organic buying. stacy_muur
- Rotation signals: Stablecoin dominance bearish, Solana dominance bullish for alts; broader altseason hype building. catchingflaws

No single non-privacy theme unites all; mindshare leaders like $PRIME/$2Z are hype-driven but lack price/gainer confirmation or MC data here. Data limits prevent exhaustive MC verification for all mentions.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 4,
    result: `TL;DR:
The top mindshare growth tokens over the last 24h are dominated by meme coins on Solana and emerging DeFi/utility plays across chains, with no single sector fully unifying them but strong meme-driven narratives (celebrity, animal, pop culture themes) leading the surge; catalysts include viral social mentions and smart account activity, though low call volumes suggest hype over sustained trading interest.

───

Top Projects by 24h Mindshare Growth
Based on Elfa AI's token leaderboard sorted by mindshare change (1d timeframe), here are the top 10 tokens with the largest increases. Mindshare reflects social mentions across monitored platforms like Crypto Twitter and Telegram.

- PRIME (+1377.88%): 16 total mentions (2 smart, 12 bullish); Ethereum-based.
- 2Z/DoubleZero (+929.52%): 11 mentions (3 smart, 6 bullish); Solana-based.
- MAMO (+862.62%): 10 mentions (3 smart, 2 bullish); Base-based.
- XDOG (+811.69%): 10 mentions (2 smart, 8 bullish); X-Layer-based.
- ZEREBRO (+798.71%): 18 mentions (2 smart, 13 bullish), 12 long calls (2 smart); Solana-based.
- TETSUO/Tetsuo Coin (+647.92%): 9 mentions (5 bullish); Solana-based.
- BNKR/BankrCoin (+647.92%): 8 mentions (1 smart, 3 bullish); Base-based.
- WHALEQUEEN/The Whale Queen (+573.76%): 13 mentions (2 smart, 6 bullish); Solana-based.
- MELANIA/Melania Meme (+565.44%): 35 mentions (2 smart, 5 bullish); Solana-based.
- FLUID (+548.07%): 7 mentions (2 smart, 4 bullish), 1 long call (1 smart); Ethereum-based.

All exhibit predominantly bullish or neutral sentiment, with minimal bearish mentions. Call activity remains low across the board (mostly zero change), except ZEREBRO (12 longs).

Common Themes and Narratives
These tokens lack a singular central sector but cluster around meme coin hype and niche utility plays:
- Meme dominance (60% of top 10): Tokens like XDOG (dog-themed), TETSUO (pop culture/Akira reference), WHALEQUEEN (whale trader meme), and MELANIA (celebrity/political figure tie-in) drive viral, community-fueled narratives typical of Solana's fast-pumping memes.
- Solana concentration: 5/10 tokens on Solana, leveraging its low-fee ecosystem for rapid memecoin launches and social pumps.
- Emerging DeFi/utility: PRIME, 2Z/DoubleZero, MAMO, BNKR, and FLUID suggest early buzz around lending, staking, or liquidity protocols (e.g., BankrCoin implies banking/DeFi, Fluid hints at fluid liquidity mechanics), but with limited calls to confirm traction.
- Overall narrative: Short-lived hype cycles fueled by FOMO mentions rather than fundamentals, as evidenced by high % changes from low mention bases (e.g., PRIME jumped from negligible to 0.10%).

Central Sector and Catalysts
No strict central sector, but memecoins emerge as the loose theme, amplified by Solana's ecosystem. Catalysts include:
- Smart account mentions: 1-3 per token (e.g., 3 for 2Z and MAMO), signaling early influencer attention without widespread calls.
- Viral sentiment spread: Bullish mentions dominate (e.g., 13/18 for ZEREBRO), likely from CT/Telegram pumps, but low absolutes (7-35 mentions) indicate nascent trends prone to quick fades.
- Chain-specific momentum: Solana memes benefit from platform liquidity and bot-driven trading; cross-chain diversity (ETH, Base, X-Layer) shows broader retail experimentation.
- Price context: Mixed performance (e.g., MELANIA at $0.19, FLUID at $3.35), with mindshare not yet translating to uniform pumps—suggesting speculative rather than conviction-driven moves.

These trends appear tradable for short-term scalps on momentum, but low call volume and small mention counts signal high risk of reversion. Monitor for sustained smart calls or volume spikes.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 9,
    result: `TL;DR:
Virtual Protocol ($VIRTUAL), Fetch.ai ($FET), and emerging ecosystems like ElizaOS and x402 are gaining traction in the crypto agent market due to their focus on autonomous trading agents, cross-chain frameworks, agent-to-agent commerce, and infrastructure for on-chain coordination, as highlighted in recent Crypto Twitter discussions and AI token leaderboards.

───

Market Overview
The crypto agent sector, encompassing AI-driven autonomous agents for trading, payments, and on-chain interactions, shows strong momentum in early 2026. Recent discussions emphasize agentic commerce—agents paying each other for data, execution, and compute—alongside DeFi strategies and agent marketplaces with "Know Your Agent" (KYA) credentialing. Tanaka_L2 notes VC allocations to AI-crypto rising significantly, positioning this as the key 2026 narrative over standalone AI tokens.

Protocols Gaining Traction
From Elfa AI's AI token leaderboard (7d timeframe) and CT chatter:

- Virtual Protocol ($VIRTUAL): Rank 2 with 6.48% mindshare (200 mentions, 36 smart). Part of x402 ecosystem maps for live agents, infrastructure, and analytics; praised for enabling agent marketplaces. Tanaka_L2.
  
- Fetch.ai ($FET): Rank 4 with 4.01% mindshare (129 mentions, 13 smart). Frequently mapped in agent ecosystems alongside $TAO and $VIRTUALS for compute and coordination. Tanaka_L2.

- ElizaOS Ecosystem: Open-source AI agent framework (cross-chain: Solana/Base/EVM) with infrastructure like ElizaCloud (TEE-secured hosting), Jeju L2 for sub-second coordination, and Otaku DeFi wallet for agent swaps. Apps include Spartan (autonomous trading agent) and Babylon (prediction markets). Gaining buzz for full-stack agent deployment. @seppmos.

Other mentions include OpenServ ($SERV, 3.60% mindshare, +143% change) and POLY AI ($POLY, 2.33% mindshare, +1529% change), but with less protocol-specific detail.

Reasons for Growth
- Autonomous Execution: Agents now handle non-custodial swaps, bridges, and trading (e.g., Spartan trained on influencer data; first autonomous video agent on Solana). @aadopico.
  
- Ecosystem Integration: x402 and ElizaOS provide end-to-end stacks (frameworks, L2s, wallets, games), enabling agent-to-agent payments and KYA identity. a16z crypto trends via leviathan_news.
  
- Narrative Shift: From hype to utility in commerce, RWAs, Bitcoin L2s, and multi-agent systems; easy launches fuel speculation on outperforming protocols. @dylangbane.

Web sources highlight broader agentic AI risks/rewards in trading (e.g., emotionless market influence), but lack specific crypto protocols. Forbes.

Mindshare is volatile—$VIRTUAL and $FET saw mindshare declines despite rankings—indicating speculative dynamics. Monitor smart calls for sustained traction.`

    source: "elfa-fast",
    speed: 10,
    result: `TL;DR:
Solana leads core trends with dominant mindshare (26.79% in 2025 per CoinGecko), superior usage metrics (e.g., #1 in MAU, transactions, app fees), and institutional traction like J.P. Morgan's debt issuance; Base trails in NFT volumes, launchpad revenue, and overall interest (13.94% mindshare) but grows via Coinbase integration. Solana appears more sustainable with stronger moat-like characteristics from network effects, high activity, and DeFi composability, while Base relies on L2 advantages but lacks Solana's independent ecosystem depth.

───

Core Trends on Solana
Solana maintains top ecosystem mindshare at 26.79% for 2025 (second consecutive year), ahead of Base (13.94%) and Ethereum (13.43%), based on CoinGecko categories traffic CoinGecko. It leads 2025 chain KPIs: #1 in monthly active users (98M, ~5x Base), transactions (34B), trading volume ($1.6T), app fees ($5B), and revenue ($1.5B) ASvanevik. Institutional adoption grows, including J.P. Morgan issuing U.S. commercial paper for Galaxy Digital on Solana Reuters. Current mindshare ranks SOL #3 at 9.93% (up 19.44% WoW). Trends emphasize high-throughput DeFi, real-time apps (e.g., Solayer for T+0 settlement), and launchpads capturing 98% revenue share ($10M weekly) SolanaSensei.

Core Trends on Base
Base shows ecosystem growth potential via Coinbase's international team, startup programs, and apps like Baseapp, with bullish sentiment for 2026 EvSlatts. However, it lags: NFT trading volume at $1.72M YTD 2026 vs Solana's $2.98M toncommunityhq; launchpad revenue ~2% of Solana's. Mindshare polls place it behind Solana, Arbitrum, BNB Defi_Warhol. Bridges see 95% volume flowing Base-to-Solana for trading, indicating users prefer Solana execution despite Base's $11.5B TVL aixbt_agent. Recent polls speculate on $BASE token airdrop to projects.

Sustainability and Moat Comparison
Solana's moat stems from proven network effects: massive usage (e.g., top fees/revenue), developer activity (#2), mature DeFi (e.g., Pendle PT-sUSDe via Chainlink CCIP), and liquidity pull from other chains jonbma. Smart accounts highlight Solana-native engineers, deep relations, and propAMM dominance as barriers to entry joaomendoncaaaa. Institutional milestones enhance resilience.

Base's moat leverages Coinbase's distribution, low-cost L2 scaling, and TradFi ties (e.g., JPMorgan mentions), but depends on Ethereum security and faces liquidity outflows to Solana. Lacks Solana's standalone throughput (60k+ TPS) and app revenue dominance.

Solana's independent L1 scale, 2x-18x metric leads, and organic growth suggest greater long-term sustainability; Base suits consumer onboarding but risks commoditization among L2s. Data as of Jan 13, 2026; trends can shift rapidly.`

Aave (AAVE), Morpho (MORPHO), and Uniswap (UNI) lead DeFi mindshare with 13.28%, 7.66% (+82.70%), and 11.08% respectively over the past 7 days; they drive narrative shifts via TVL growth in lending (Aave doubled YoY, Morpho at ~5-6% DeFi TVL share) and DEX activity, fueled by protocol upgrades, ecosystem expansions on chains like Monad/Solana, and a broader pivot from passive staking to active lending/restaking.

───

Mindshare Leaders from Elfa AI Leaderboard
The top DeFi protocols by 7-day mindshare are Aave, Uniswap, and Morpho, per Elfa AI's token leaderboard (sorted by top mindshare, DeFi category). Aave holds the #1 spot at 13.28% mindshare (809 total mentions, 207 smart), despite a -4.32% dip. Morpho ranks #4 with 7.66% (+82.70% change, 466 mentions), signaling rapid gains. Uniswap follows at #2 with 11.08% (670 mentions). These reflect concentrated discussion on established lending/DEX primitives amid TVL shifts.

TVL Growth and Narrative Shifts
DeFi TVL rankings show a shift from passive staking (e.g., Lido down) to active lending (Aave, Morpho), restaking (EigenLayer, ether.fi), and stables (Ethena, Sky) year-over-year as of Jan 12, 2026 (CryptoDiffer). Aave's TVL doubled from Jan 2025-2026 (doomsdart); Morpho's DeFi TVL share hit ~5-6%, with steady growth since 2023 (PaulFrambot, tokenterminal). Overall DeFi TVL remains flat YoY, prompting calls for liquidity waves via Aave v4 and apps (alphaleaked).

Emerging chains like Monad drive niche momentum: TVL >$300M (+10% WoW), led by Curvance ($42M, +11%), Neverland (+38%), and Kintsu (+26%) via incentives, liquid staking, and lending (FishMarketAcad). Solana protocols like Kamino (2.81% mindshare, +22%) gain via vault curation (viktorfischer).

Reasons for Momentum
- Lending dominance: Aave and Morpho benefit from risk-adjusted yields and integrations; Morpho vaults attract deposits as DeFi seeks sustainable revenue post-staking fatigue.
- Ecosystem catalysts: Monad's hyper-growth (MON +20% WoW) ties to onchain integrations (e.g., Kalshi) and high APR pools (up to 185% on Merkl); Solana pushes vaults ([KMNO, JTO mindshare surges]).
- Broader context: DeFi loses ground to ZK/privacy narratives (0xNairolf), but low-risk plays like Maple ($2.5B TVL, zero incentives) highlight quality over hype. Pendle (6.35%) adds yield-trading mindshare.
