    "finalAnswer": "TL;DR:\nNo specific data on the highest growth in new traders over the last 4 hours is available from current sources. Zcash (ZEC) shows notable discussion of new holders replacing shaken-out buyers, while top mindshare gainers include Bitcoin (+17.60%), Solana (+12.68%), and Fartcoin (+44.74%), which may indicate rising trader interest.\n\n---\n\nThe provided research data, including Elfa AI's token leaderboard for the 4h timeframe, tweet searches on terms like \"new traders\" and \"new buyers,\" and top influencer calls, does not contain direct metrics on growth in new traders (e.g., unique wallet counts or on-chain buyer surges).\n\nTweets mentioning trader activity include one noting \"$Z strength... alot of early buyers got shaken out and replaced by fresh/new holders in the last 24 hours\" Dvcryptzz, suggesting potential new trader inflow for Zcash (ZEC), which ranks #4 on the leaderboard with a -19.32% mindshare change but recent long calls.\n\nElfa AI 4h Mindshare Leaders (proxy for attention/trader interest):\n- Bitcoin (BTC): 28.14% mindshare, +17.60% change, 1032 mentions\n- Ethereum (ETH): 13.30%, +10.85% change, 433 mentions\n- Solana (SOL): 9.90%, +12.68% change, 318 mentions\n- Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): 0.84%, +44.74% change, 27 mentions\n\nThese reflect mindshare growth rather than confirmed new trader metrics. Influencer calls focus on BTC, ZEC, and others but lack new trader specifics. For precise new trader data, Elfa AI may track this internally via smart accounts or on-chain analysis, but it's not in the current dataset.",
