    "finalAnswer": "TL;DR:\nInsufficient data available on TVL, revenue figures, or growth metrics for Uniswap and Aerodrome to build a meaningful investment case comparison. General DeFi TVL exceeded $160B in Q3 2025 (Forbes), but no protocol-specific or recent 2026 numbers were found.\n\n---\n\nCurrent research lacks direct, up-to-date TVL, revenue, or growth figures for Uniswap or Aerodrome. Searches covering Dec 2025 to Jan 2026 returned no quantifiable metrics for either protocol.\n\nUniswap saw a token burn of 100M UNI with rising buying interest noted in late 2025 (TradingView), but this does not provide TVL or revenue data. Aerodrome was mentioned in a Dec 2025 launch of a gold token on Base (The Fintech Times), indicating ecosystem activity without financial metrics.\n\nWithout reliable, specific data on these key indicators, I cannot construct or recommend an investment case. Acknowledge my limits: analysis relies solely on provided search results, which do not contain the required details. For accurate insights, check dedicated DeFi analytics platforms like DefiLlama or Dune Analytics directly.",
