    "finalAnswer": "TL;DR:\nNo specific data is available on crypto sectors with the most revenue growth over the last 30 days (Dec 13, 2025–Jan 13, 2026). Available sources focus on M&A deals ($8.6B in 2025), IPOs ($14.6B raised), and predictions for 2026 growth in areas like prediction markets and RWAs, but lack direct revenue metrics by sector.\n\nData Limitations\nThe research data from web searches, tweets, and token leaderboards does not provide quantitative revenue growth figures for crypto sectors over the queried 30-day period. Tweets mention privacy coins as bullish in price performance over the last 30 days source\n@cryptorand\n, while RWAs lagged, but this refers to price action, not revenue. Leaderboard data shows mindshare leaders like BTC, ETH, and SOL, with no revenue insights.\n\nRelevant 2025 Highlights\nCrypto saw record activity in 2025, including $8.6B in deals (e.g., Coinbase's $2.9B Deribit acquisition, Kraken's $1.5B NinjaTrader buy) driven by Trump-era policies source\nCryptopolitan\n; source\nTradingView/Cointelegraph\n. IPOs raised $14.6B across firms like Bullish ($1.1B), Circle ($1B+), and Gemini ($425M), signaling institutional momentum",
