    "finalAnswer": "TL;DR:\nJito (JTO) has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, with allocations to community growth, ecosystem development, core contributors, and investors. Vesting is staged over several years, and the JTO token is used for governance, protocol fee distribution, and potential buybacks, aiming to align incentives across the Solana MEV and liquid staking ecosystem.  \n───\n\nToken Supply and Distribution\n\nJito (JTO) is capped at a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. The distribution is as follows:\n- Community Growth: 34.3% (342,857,143 JTO)\n- Ecosystem Development: 25% (250,000,000 JTO)\n- Core Contributors: 24.5% (245,000,000 JTO)\n- Investors: 16.2% (162,142,857 JTO)\n\nVesting Schedule\n\n- Airdrop: 100 million JTO, with 90 million unlocked immediately and 10 million vesting linearly over 12 months.\n- Core Contributors: 245 million JTO, subject to a cliff and then linear vesting over 24 months.\n- Investors: 162 million JTO, also with a cliff and linear vesting over 24 months.\n- Ecosystem Development: 250 million JTO, vesting linearly over 48 months.\n\nAs of January 2026, around 423 million JTO are in circulation, with the remainder subject to ongoing vesting schedules. You can find up-to-date unlock and vesting charts on tracking platforms and the official Jito blog Tokenomist Dropstab.\n\nUtility and Economic Mechanisms\n\nJTO is the governance token of the Jito Network. Holders can vote on protocol upgrades, treasury allocations, and other governance decisions. The token is designed to accrue value via protocol fee distribution: a portion of the fees generated by Jito’s MEV infrastructure and liquid staking products is directed to the DAO treasury, which can be used for buybacks, yield subsidies, or ecosystem incentives. In 2025, Jito introduced a buyback program (using TWAP mechanisms) to stabilize price and reduce circulating supply, funded by protocol revenues The Block Ainvest.\n\nRecent Updates and Governance\n\nThe DAO can adapt tokenomics based on market conditions, including switching between buybacks (in bear markets) and yield incentives (during growth phases). Notably, JIP-24 doubled DAO revenue from block engine fees, and the DAO can also allocate tokens to protocol-owned liquidity or ecosystem partnerships Jito Forum.\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Allocation             | % of Total | Vesting Details             |\n|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Community Growth       | 34.3%      | Airdrop, 12-18 month vest   |\n| Ecosystem Development  | 25%        | Linear, 48 months           |\n| Core Contributors      | 24.5%      | Cliff + linear, 24 months   |\n| Investors              | 16.2%      | Cliff + linear, 24 months   |\n\nConclusion\n\nJTO’s tokenomics are structured to incentivize long-term alignment among stakeholders, with value accrual from protocol fees and active governance. The vesting schedule and buyback mechanisms are intended to manage supply and reward participation, but market reaction to these mechanisms has been mixed, reflecting broader crypto market dynamics.\n\nFor more details and the latest updates, refer to the official Jito documentation and governance forum Jito Network Jito Forum.",
