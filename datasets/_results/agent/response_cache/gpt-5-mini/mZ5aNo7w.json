        "text": "Short answer (30-day window = ~Dec 14, 2025 → Jan 13, 2026): the biggest recent revenue growth has been concentrated in (1) derivatives / perpetuals & centralized-style trading venues, (2) Layer‑2 rollups / L2 ecosystems, (3) liquid‑staking / staking services, and (4) bridge / infra activity — with NFT/gaming pockets on some chains. Below I summarize the top sectors, the protocols that drove the move, the proximate catalysts and the data sources I used.\n\n1) Derivatives / Perps & centralized-style DEXs\n- Key protocols: Hyperliquid (combined/perps), Lighter (perp/derivatives platforms), dYdX / similar venues.\n- Evidence: DefiLlama revenue snapshot (early Jan) shows Hyperliquid ~ $51.0M revenue (30d) and Lighter ~ $6.45M (30d) (Hyperliquid is by far the biggest 30d revenue generator among trading/perps). Source: DefiLlama protocol pages (Hyperliquid, Lighter).  \n- Catalysts: renewed volatility and macro flow → higher perp volumes/fees; product launches/feature upgrades and aggressive liquidity incentives for market‑making; concentration of orderflow on high‑performance orderbook/perp venues (higher fee capture).\n- Why it matters: perps concentrate lots of volume into a few protocol treasuries — spikes in volume quickly show up as revenue growth.\n\n2) Layer‑2 rollups / L2 ecosystems\n- Key protocols/apps: Base (and apps on Base), Arbitrum ecosystem, Optimism/Linea and high‑usage L2 apps; also chain-level revenue leaders like Solana in other contexts.  \n- Evidence & numbers: multiple data / reporting threads in December showed Base and other L2s posting big revenue gains in 2025 and high recent activity (Messari/PANews/Blockworks reporting; DefiLlama chain/app earnings pages show large 30d fees for Base apps and for chains with big app ecosystems). TradingView/Cointelegraph also reported increased transactions on several chains in late Dec.  \n- Catalysts: distribution/on‑ramps (Coinbase ↔ Base), large app launches (gaming, tokenization, social apps), cheaper gas and better UX leading to higher retention, concentrated airdrops/marketing pushing user acquisition. L2 scalability improvements → more application-level activity and revenue capture.  \n- Why it matters: L2s with good distribution or a “super‑app” (or a big DEX/perp) can quickly scale revenue as users migrate to lower fees and high throughput.\n\n3) Liquid staking / staking services\n- Key protocols: Lido, Jito (Solana‑side staking/MEV capture), Rocket Pool and other staking services.  \n- Evidence: DefiLlama shows Lido fees/revenue 30d in the mid‑single millions ($6.2M fees 30d / revenue 30d ~ $6.22M on Lido snapshot) and Jito shows material fees (Jito fees 30d ~$15.2M, revenue 30d smaller but notable).  \n- Catalysts: continued inflows into staking products (ETH staking demand), staking yield products being adopted by institutions and DeFi users, MEV/validator‑level activity growth on Solana boosting validator revenues (Jito). ETH price/staking narrative and protocol improvements increase TVL → recurring revenue growth.\n\n4) Bridges & cross‑chain infra\n- Key protocols: major bridges (Optimism bridge, Base bridge, “Portal”/Wormhole components and other canonical bridges).  \n- Evidence: DefiLlama shows large 30d bridge volumes on many bridge protocols and some upticks in bridge inflows for certain chains; bridge fees/revenue rise when cross‑chain flows pick up.  \n- Catalysts: portfolio rebalancing between chains, large token migrations, airdrop/bridging campaigns, and traders moving liquidity ahead of app launches or tokenomics events. Bridges are often sensitive to single large flows, so short windows show large % swings.\n\n5) NFT / Gaming marketplaces & onchain consumer apps (pockets)\n- Key protocols: Magic Eden (Solana), Immutable, Base‑gaming apps, and selected marketplace/creator platforms.  \n- Evidence: ecosystem reporting that Base apps and certain NFT marketplaces had outsized revenue growth in late 2025; DefiLlama/app‑level pages register spikes in 30d fees for marketplaces on active chains.  \n- Catalysts: game launches, seasonal drops, NFT projects with renewed secondary market volume, and integrations with L2s that dramatically lower fees for trading.\n\nCaveats / methodology notes\n- Sources I used: DefiLlama protocol/earnings pages for 30d revenue/fees snapshots (protocol pages for Hyperliquid, Lighter, Lido, Jito, Base/chain/app pages), industry writeups (Blockworks/PANews/Messari reporting on Base and L2 revenue), and a TradingView/Cointelegraph piece noting transaction increases across chains (Dec 29, 2025). Links: DefiLlama protocol pages (e.g., Hyperliquid, Lighter, Lido, Jito) and the TradingView/Cointelegraph onchain summary. I can paste the exact links if you want them.  \n- “Revenue growth” here is based on 30d revenue/fees snapshots (absolute 30d revenue) and recent reporting — I did not compute protocol‑level % change vs the prior 30d for every protocol. Absolute 30d revenue is useful to identify which sectors/protocols currently collect the most onchain fees; measuring growth rates requires time‑series comparisons (30d vs previous 30d) which I can run if you want.  \n- Onchain revenue is volatile and concentrated: single events (large perp flow, airdrop, bridging wave, or NFT drop) can create big temporary spikes. Be careful extrapolating short‑window growth to long‑term trends.\n\nIf you want:\n- I can run a quick 30d vs prior‑30d growth ranking (top sectors and top protocols by % change and absolute change) and deliver a table with numbers and links.  \n- Or focus on one sector (e.g., perps or L2s) and give a deeper breakdown of which protocols and exact drivers (product launches, incentives, volumes, fees) moved the needle.\n\nWhich follow‑up would you prefer?",
