If you want, I can then run a deeper live screen (on‑chain activity, developer commits, detailed chart indicators, unlock schedules) and produce ranked entries with exact buy/stop levels.\n\nQuick definitions / constraints I used\n- Small cap = projects with market cap roughly $10M–$250M. Mid cap = ~$250M–$2B. (I can change these ranges to your preference.)\n- “Promising” = scores high across these quant buckets: liquidity/momentum, on‑chain user growth, developer activity, social engagement momentum, tokenomics (circ supply, unlock risk), and addressable narrative (product-market fit).\n\nQuant methodology (summary)\n- Liquidity & momentum: 24h spot volume / market cap, recent volume spikes, futures open interest where relevant.\n- On‑chain traction: active addresses, tx counts and their 30d trend (if available).\n- Developer activity: commits, releases, GitHub / repos activity trend.\n- Tokenomics & unlocks: circ/total, FDV ratio, upcoming big unlocks (30–180d).\n- Technical setup: price vs recent resistance (breakout), relative volume increase, basic trend: above/below 50/200-day MAs and RSI context (momentum vs overbought).\n- Catalysts: mainnet/upgrade, airdrop/token unlock, partnerships, app launches, validator onboarding, or grant programs.\n\nPreliminary shortlist (small → mid caps) — high conviction picks to investigate deeper\nNote: marketcap & volume numbers below are taken from recent project pages / coverage (Dec 2025 → early Jan 2026). I’ll run deeper live metrics if you want.\n\n1) Dymension (DYM) — modular L1 / “RollApps”\n- Quick quant: market cap ≈ $90–110M; 24h spot volume ≈ $8–12M; FDV ≈ $300–350M; circ supply ~280M.\n- Technical setup: decent volume-to-mcap ratio (good liquidity for a small cap). Price has seen recent uptick on rollup/modular narrative.\n- Catalysts: growth of rollapp launches, ecosystem grants, integrations with Cosmos/IBC tooling. Modular-rollup narrative remains in focus among builders.\n- Narrative sustainability: addresses real scalability trend (modular blockchains + app-specific execution). Strong developer-focused narrative; sustainability depends on actual app launches and TVL growth.\n- Risks: competition from other modular/rollup ecosystems; FDV/large total supply could weigh if unlocks happen.\n\n2) Axelar (AXL) — cross-chain communication network\n- Quick quant: market cap ≈ $120–150M; 24h vol ≈ $10–20M; Mcap/FDV high (~80–90% in recent snapshot).\n- Technical setup: healthy liquidity, steady volume; technicals often favorable for swing trades when cross-chain news hits.\n- Catalysts: integrations with major chains, cross-chain tooling adoption, SDK improvements, relayer partnerships.\n- Narrative sustainability: cross-chain messaging and interoperability is core infrastructure — large TAM and repeated product need. Token sustainability depends on utility growth (fees, governance usage).\n- Risks: many interoperability competitors; actual revenue capture by the token is often limited.\n\n3) SOON (Solana Optimistic Network) — Solana L2 / SVM stack\n- Quick quant: market cap ≈ $120–160M; 24h vol ≈ $5–10M; FDV mid‑hundreds M.\n- Technical setup: looks like a momentum play among Solana-native L2s; watch for breakouts on volume and SVM app launches.\n- Catalysts: mainnet features, SVM tooling for devs, partnerships with Solana dApps.\n- Narrative sustainability: Solana-focused scaling + better EVM/SVM compatibility is an attractive niche; adoption-driven.\n- Risks: technical execution on optimistic semantics and data availability; Solana ecosystem cyclicality.\n\n4) IoTeX (IOTX) — DePIN / IoT-focused chain & devices\n- Quick quant: market cap ≈ $150–200M; 24h vol ≈ $3–6M; high circ/FDV ratio (~100%).\n- Technical setup: steady volume, looks like consolidation with occasional breakouts tied to device/product announcements.\n- Catalysts: device partnerships, real-world DePIN deployments, new data & compute offerings, enterprise pilots.\n- Narrative sustainability: DePIN + IoT has real-world utility and recurring revenue potential (if device adoption scales); this is a longer-term fundamentals story.\n- Risks: hardware adoption is slow and capital intensive; token value depends on how much on-chain utility accrues.\n\n5) Initia (INIT) — Cosmos L1 focused on app-specific L2s\n- Quick quant: market cap ≈ $15–25M (very small); 24h vol ≈ $15–25M (very high volume-to-mcap ratio — indicates speculative flows).\n- Technical setup: extreme volume relative to mcap → volatile; technically either a breakout/squeeze candidate or risky momentum fade.\n- Catalysts: app launches (RollApp-style), IBC integrations, developer toolkits on Cosmos.\n- Narrative sustainability: the app-L2 + modular Cosmos story is compelling, but requires actual onboarding of projects to be sustainable.\n- Risks: very high volatility; watch token unlocks and concentrated holdings.\n\n6) Monad (MON) — recently launched L1 (airdrop/mainnet tailwinds)\n- Quick context: launched mainnet + airdrop late 2025; heavy coverage; tokenomics and airdrop drove initial attention.\n- Technical setup: lots of headline-driven momentum; trading debuts can be weak or volatile after the initial airdrop/sale.\n- Catalysts: further mainnet features, developer incentives, Coinbase token sale exposure, ecosystem grants.\n- Narrative sustainability: a new L1 can capture developer mindshare if it has differentiated technical benefits (speed, EVM compat, tooling). Tokenomics (team/investor allocations) and unlock schedules are a major determinant of sustainability.\n- Risks: new L1s face fierce competition and often suffer from token distribution criticisms and supply pressure.\n\nWhy these made the shortlist (quant reasons)\n- Marketcap range that allows upside if adoption accelerates.\n- Liquidity/momentum (24h volume / marketcap) looks healthy for Dymension, Axelar, SOON — meaning easier to enter/exit relative to very illiquid microcaps.\n- Real product narratives (modular rollups, cross‑chain messaging, DePIN/IoT, Solana L2, Cosmos app-ledgers) with developer pull.\n- Visible catalysts in the near‑to‑medium term (mainnet upgrades, app launches, airdrops, partnerships) that historically drive small/mid cap moves.\n\nRisks & guardrails\n- Small/mid caps are high risk: token unlocks, low liquidity, rug/centralization risks, narrative fizzles.\n- I’m not giving buy/sell signals here — I can produce those if you want them, but they’d be based on live charting and your risk/holding timeframe.\n- Always check token unlock schedules and concentrated wallet distribution before sizing positions.\n\nNext steps (pick one)\n1) I run a focused, live quant screen on these (and up to 20 candidates) and return a ranked top-5 with:\n   - up-to-date marketcap, volume, volume/mcap ratio,\n   - 30d active addresses change,\n   - GitHub commits trend,\n   - upcoming unlocks within 180d,\n   - chart indicators (50/200 MA, RSI, recent breakout levels),\n   - suggested position sizing framework and watchlist entry/stop levels.\n2) Or I deepen research on 2–3 of the above you like (team, tokenomics, unlocks, contract addresses, Dune/Glassnode metrics).\n3) Or change the cap-range / sectors (e.g., only DePIN, only Cosmos/Solana, or add NFTs/AI on-chain projects).\n\nWhich next step do you want? If #1 or #2, tell me: preferred cap-range, time horizon (swing weeks, months, long-term), and how many picks to return.",
