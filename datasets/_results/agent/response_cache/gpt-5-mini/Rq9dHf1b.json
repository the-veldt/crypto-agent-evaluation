Governance passed token‑friendly proposals / a fee‑switch and burn in late‑2025 that materially changes future revenue capture.\n  - Market cap (UNI): ≈ $3.5–6.0B (different data sources vary; DefiLlama showed ≈ $6.0B)\n- Aerodrome (AERO; Base)\n  - TVL: ≈ $485M\n  - Fees (annualized): ≈ $72.8M\n  - Revenue (annualized, holders revenue on DefiLlama): ≈ $72.8M (Aerodrome’s token/holders capture is explicit in current design)\n  - Incentives (annualized): ≈ $89.8M → Earnings (revenue − incentives) ≈ −$17M (i.e., net negative after subsidies)\n  - Market cap (AERO): ≈ $0.31–0.50B depending on source (DefiLlama listed ≈ $496M; CoinGecko/Messari give other snapshots)\n\nSimple unit economics / valuation ratios\n- Fee yield (annualized fees / TVL)\n  - Uniswap ≈ $648M / $5.09B ≈ 12.7% p.a.\n  - Aerodrome ≈ $72.8M / $0.485B ≈ 15.0% p.a.\n  - Interpretation: Aerodrome shows slightly higher gross fee yield per unit TVL (reflects high volume/turnover on Base & fee structure).\n- Market cap / TVL\n  - Uniswap ≈ 1.19 (using DefiLlama mcap $6.04B and TVL $5.09B)\n  - Aerodrome ≈ 1.02 (mcap ≈ $496M / TVL ≈ $485M)\n  - Interpretation: both trade around ~1× TVL, Aerodrome slightly cheaper by this metric (but see risks below).\n- Market cap / (token holder) revenue\n  - Aerodrome ≈ $496M / $72.8M ≈ 6.8× revenue (price / annual revenue)\n  - Uniswap: historical protocol revenue ≈ $0 (so this metric is not meaningful historically). With late‑2025 governance changes (fee switch / burn proposals) Uniswap’s revenue capture profile is changing — this is a key catalyst.\n\nQualitative comparison (what drives value to tokenholders)\n- Uniswap\n  - Scale & distribution: market leader in DEX volume across multiple chains (Ethereum + many L2s), deep liquidity, broad ecosystem integrations.\n  - Revenue capture historically limited: most trading fees go to LPs; protocol (UNI) historically captured little revenue. That changed in late‑2025 governance moves (fee switch / burning 100M UNI and fee-sharing proposals) — this creates a path to direct token economic upside.\n  - Durability: multi‑chain presence, high developer activity, strong network effects; less concentrated on any single chain.\n  - Risks: execution of new tokenomics (fee switching, burns, auctions) matters — failing to deliver could limit UNI upside. Competition on L2s and migration of liquidity to alternative AMMs/hooks also a risk. Regulatory / governance complexity.\n- Aerodrome\n  - Clear revenue capture today: protocol design sends revenue to holders (visible in trackers), so token holders see an economic link to on‑chain activity now.\n  - Rapid growth & product-market fit on Base: high DEX volume and TVL growth were driven by Base adoption and aggressive incentive programs / listings (CEX listings, e.g., eToro reported).\n  - Incentive intensity: Aerodrome is spending substantial incentives (annualized incentives > revenue), producing negative net earnings that dilute/pressure token economics while bootstrapping liquidity and volume.\n  - Concentration: heavily concentrated on Base (single-chain risk). Competitive threat from Uniswap V4/hook-enabled AMMs on Base that may capture liquidity over time.\n  - Smart-contract / MEV / audit risk like any DEX fork.\n\nHow to interpret the numbers from an investor POV\n- Gross fee yield (fees/TVL) is useful for comparing how much economic activity a vault/DEX generates per locked capital. Aerodrome shows a slightly higher raw yield (≈15% vs ≈13%), meaning LPs/protocol see more turnover per dollar of TVL.\n- Who captures those fees matters more:\n  - Aerodrome: holders/token economy already capture revenue (but net earnings negative due to subsidies).\n  - Uniswap: historically tokenholders didn’t capture protocol fees (fees went to LPs); that made UNI behave more like a governance token than a revenue token. Late‑2025 governance moves are changing this — if implemented and sustained, UNI could convert some of the large platform fees into tokenholder returns (burns/fee‑share), which is a material upside given Uniswap’s scale.\n- Valuation: Aerodrome’s current market cap roughly equals its TVL (≈1×) and implies a relatively high revenue multiple (~6.8× on current tokenholder revenue). Uniswap’s market cap / TVL also ~1× but future revenue capture could compress multiples if fee flows are directed to UNI.\n\nCatalysts\n- Uniswap\n  - Successful implementation of the fee switch / fee burn and any subsequent protocol revenue auction/buyback mechanics.\n  - Continued migration/adoption of Uniswap V4 hooks and L2 Superchain liquidity expansion.\n  - Any governance actions that reduce token supply (burns) or increase UNI utility.\n- Aerodrome\n  - Continued Base chain growth and new token listings/partnerships.\n  - Successful conversion of incentive-driven activity into organic, incentive‑free trading volume (i.e., earnings turn positive).\n  - Wider CEX distribution and sustained TVL retention after incentive tapering.\n\nRisks / red flags\n- Uniswap\n  - Governance failure or community backlash around fee changes; regulatory scrutiny as protocols monetize.\n  - Liquidity migration to other AMMs or centralized liquidity venues.\n- Aerodrome\n  - Incentive-driven growth that reverses when subsidies stop → TVL and volume may fall.\n  - Single‑chain concentration (Base) increases protocol/chain risk.\n  - Token dilution from continued incentives, and potential overvaluation if incentives stop and volume collapses.\n\nPractical investor takeaways / suggested positions\n- Conservative / long‑term (lower risk): prefer Uniswap\n  - Why: scale, multi‑chain diversification, massive existing fee base that can be monetized for UNI holders if governance proposals are executed. UNI is closer to a “blue‑chip” DeFi exposure.\n- Growth / higher‑risk (seeking higher yield and faster upside): consider Aerodrome with position sizing discipline\n  - Why: higher immediate fee capture to holders and higher fee yields per TVL; but requires close monitoring of incentive tapering and retention of liquidity.\n- Portfolio sizing idea (illustrative, not financial advice):\n  - Risk‑off allocator: 75% Uniswap / 25% Aerodrome\n  - Risk‑seeking allocator: 50% Uniswap / 50% Aerodrome (or overweight Aerodrome smaller sizes due to higher idiosyncratic risk)\n- Due diligence checklist before buying either token:\n  - Verify the latest on‑chain fee share mechanics / treasury flows (post‑fee‑switch for Uniswap).\n  - Check incentive schedules and upcoming unlocks for Aerodrome (token emission/incentives timeline).\n  - Monitor volume & TVL trends for 30–90 days after any planned incentive taper.\n  - Review governance proposals, safeties, audits, and CEX listings.\n\nBottom line\n- Uniswap = scale + optionality. It is the safer, larger protocol with the biggest potential upside if governance successfully redirects some of the protocol’s large fee base to tokenholders (this is an actionable catalyst starting late‑2025).\n- Aerodrome = higher immediate revenue capture and yield per TVL but materially higher execution/dilution risk because growth has been subsidy‑driven and is more concentrated on Base.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull live/dated DefiLlama & Messari snapshots (TVL / fees / incentives / market cap) to a specific timestamp and produce a one‑page comparison table with exact source links; or\n- Build a sensitivity model showing token valuation under different fee‑capture scenarios (e.g., what UNI’s token value could look like if X% of fees are allocated to token buybacks/burns).
