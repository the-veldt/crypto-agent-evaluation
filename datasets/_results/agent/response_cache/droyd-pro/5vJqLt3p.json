Moat is composability + UX + anti-bot design, not “curation.”\\n- **Mechanism moat** (MetaDAO futarchy): launch is bundled with **treasury policy** (buy/sell bands, constrained spending).

Market share growth comes from being the default for “retail-first, compliant, oversubscribed” raises.  \\n- **Echo / Coinbase stack (Sonar)**: the “gold standard” path for teams that want **exchange-grade compliance + distribution**. The moat is Coinbase itself; share gains come from bundling sales → listing → liquidity under one roof.\\n\\n**Onchain issuance (memes/ICM): incumbents defend, challengers steal edges**  \\n- **Pump-style factories** dominate raw volume (one dataset shows **~56% share** for Pump in a 24h window), but the vulnerability is creator extraction + low bonding quality.  \\n- **Meteora** is the credible share-taker: the table highlights **~96% bonded** (conversion) versus Pump’s tiny bonded rate.
