Coinbase’s Payments MCP lets agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.) create wallets, on‑ramp, and send stablecoin payments from prompts (TradingView/The Block; Decrypt/Yahoo).\n- Why it’s working:\n  - Agents need low‑friction, programmable payments; HTTP‑native x402 + stablecoins on a cheap L2 (Base) is compelling for per‑request micro‑payments and API gating (x402 whitepaper; Coinbase/Cloudflare).\n  - Early infra partner momentum and clean DX will likely pull more web services into agentic paywalls.\n\nSources: x402.org; x402 whitepaper (x402.org/x402-whitepaper.pdf); blog.cloudflare.com/x402; tradingview.com/news/the_block:...-coinbase-unveils-tool-for-ai-agents; decrypt.co/.../coinbase-ai-crypto-payments-new-protocol\n\n4) NEAR Shade Agents – verifiable, non‑custodial multi‑chain agents\n- Evidence of traction:\n  - Formal framework launched with docs and examples; integrates TEEs and NEAR Chain Signatures to keep agents verifiable, non‑custodial, and able to sign on any chain (NEAR docs/blog).\n- Why it’s working:\n  - Solves a real blocker for serious agent use: custody + verification with privacy. Attractive for finance and enterprise agents needing attestable behavior and multi‑chain signing.\n\nSources: docs.near.org/ai/shade-agents/introduction; pages.near.org/blog/shade-agents-the-first-truly-autonomous-ai-agents\n\n5) GaiaNet (GAIA) – decentralized agent hosting/inference infra\n- Evidence of traction:\n  - $20M raised (seed + Series A); partnerships (e.g., io.net GPUs); claims of large node installs and revenue via exchange/marketing materials (Gaia blog; Chainwire; Bitget Academy).\n- Why it’s working:\n  - Agents need cheap, distributed inference and hosting. A DePIN‑style network + token incentives is a natural fit as agent volumes grow.\n\nSources: gaianet.ai/blog/gaia-labs-raises-20m-series-a; chainwire.org/.../io-net-and-gaia-partner-to-streamline-ai-agent-network-inferencing; bitget.com/academy/what-is-gaia-and-how-does-it-work\n\n6) AgentFi – onchain DeFi agents as tradable NFTs (early but interesting)\n- Evidence of traction:\n  - Backed by Generative Ventures/Spartan Labs; live strategies on Blast; NFT‑native agent packaging and marketplace plans (agentfi.io; docs).\n- Why it’s working:\n  - Meets existing crypto demand (packaged strategies, memetics, secondary trading of “agents with track record”). Early but aligns with DeFi user behavior.\n\nSources: agentfi.io; docs.agentfi.io\n\nAlso relevant “execution substrate” for agents\n- CoW Protocol (intents/solvers) is widely used by bots/agents to execute programmatic orders with MEV‑aware routing and hooks (docs.cow.fi). It’s not an “agent network,” but a mature layer many agents already rely on.\n\nWhy these are winning\n- Distribution and UX: App stores/marketplaces for agents (Olas Pearl; Mech; Agentverse) reduce friction for both developers and users.\n- Verifiable autonomy: Security/custody primitives (NEAR TEEs + Chain Signatures; Olas Proof of Active Agent) make it viable to let agents hold funds and act without humans.\n- Payments that fit agents: x402 + stablecoins on L2s give sub‑$1, sub‑second payments that agents can trigger natively.\n- Clear onchain usage: Olas publicly reports agent transactions/DAAs and agent‑to‑agent activity, which builds credibility; Fetch/ASI highlights massive agent directories and enterprise‑oriented orchestration.\n- Institutional/equity tailwinds: Funding (Olas core contributor, Gaia $20M) and custody (BitGo for ASI) de‑risk adoption.\n\nHow to track this market (practical KPIs)\n- Agent activity: agent transactions/day, daily active agents, share of agent‑to‑agent requests (Olas reports these).\n- Payments rails: x402 monthly transactions, unique buyers/sellers, USDC/Base flows tied to agent endpoints (x402.org).\n- Discovery/distribution: Agentverse listings and active agents, usage of ASI:One endpoints, uAgents SDK adoption.\n- Security/verification: deployments using Shade Agents (TEEs/Chain Signatures), audits/attestations.\n- Economic outcomes: agent marketplace GMV (Mech; AgentFi), realized PnL for DeFAI agents, stablecoin volumes attributable to agent commerce.\n\nRisks and open questions\n- Real vs promotional usage: Some stats (e.g., directory counts, node installs) can be inflated; prioritize verifiable onchain metrics and third‑party dashboards.\n- Security/governance: Rogue agents, key management, and model‑induced errors; frameworks with verifiability and constraints should fare better.\n- Standard fragmentation: ASI:One vs other agent protocols, x402 vs alternatives; watch where developers converge.\n\nBottom line\n- Today’s clear leader in onchain usage is Olas (measurable multi‑chain agent and agent‑to‑agent activity, plus a working marketplace and app store).\n- For AI→onchain orchestration and enterprise reach, Fetch.ai/ASI:One + Agentverse looks strongest.\n- For payments, x402/Payments MCP is the early default, thanks to stablecoins and a light‑touch, HTTP‑native integration.\n- NEAR’s Shade Agents is the most credible bet on verifiable, non‑custodial agents operating across chains.\n- DePIN‑style infra (GaiaNet) and DeFi‑packaged agents (AgentFi) are emerging complements that could scale as agent commerce grows.\n\nIf you want, tell me the sub‑segment you care about (DeFi agents, consumer AI payments, or enterprise orchestration), and I’ll draft a shortlist with metrics to monitor and teams to contact.",
