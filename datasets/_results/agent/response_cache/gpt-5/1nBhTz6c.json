Typically among the largest Solana memes by market cap and volume.\n- Notes: Good for liquidity-first exposure to the Solana meme sector.\n- Reference: CoinGecko’s Solana meme category shows BONK among the top by mcap alongside WIF/POPCAT.\n\n2) dogwifhat (ticker: WIF)\n- Why: Arguably the strongest brand/meme on Solana, heavy social reach, strong CEX presence, and high derivatives/spot turnover when memes run.\n- Notes: High beta vs. broader meme rotations; strong community supports sustained interest.\n- Reference: CMC coverage regularly highlights WIF in meme sector moves; see CMC Academy weekly meme recaps.\n\n3) POPCAT (ticker: POPCAT)\n- Why: Leading cat-coin on Solana with growing exchange support and on-chain liquidity; benefits when “cat meme” narratives rotate.\n- Notes: Tends to move sharply during risk-on meme cycles.\n- Reference: CMC token page for POPCAT and recent mentions in CMC Academy news during meme rallies.\n\nHonorable mentions (smaller-cap/higher-risk): MEW (cat in a dog’s world), PONKE, and various Pump.fun rotations. These can run hard but carry far higher rug/liquidity risk.\n\nHow to play on Solana\n- Use Jupiter (jup.ag) to route swaps across Raydium/Orca for best price.\n- Always verify the contract address and check basic safety (e.g., RugCheck) before buying.\n- Expect high volatility and set appropriate slippage and size accordingly.\n\nQuick sources\n- Solana meme coins by market cap: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins\n- POPCAT page: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/popcat-sol/\n- Meme sector news mentioning WIF/POPCAT/BONK moves: https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/pepe-leads-32percent-meme-coin-rally-in-post-holiday-bounce\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your style (large-cap/liquidity vs. degen microcaps) and share current market caps, liquidity, and primary pools for each.
