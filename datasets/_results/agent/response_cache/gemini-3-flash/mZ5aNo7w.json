        "text": "Based on revenue data and market trends over the last 30 days, the most significant revenue growth has been concentrated in the **Memecoin Infrastructure**, **Stablecoin/Yield Protocols**, and **Ethereum Layer 2 (L2)** sectors. \n\nWhile established Layer 1s like Ethereum and Bitcoin remain the largest in total revenue, the highest *growth rates* and most dynamic activity are coming from the following sectors:\n\n### 1. Memecoin Launch & Trading Infrastructure\nThis sector has seen explosive growth, primarily centered on the Solana ecosystem. \n*   **Key Protocols:** **Pump.fun** and **Raydium**.\n*   **Performance:** Pump.fun has emerged as a revenue titan, frequently generating over **$1 million in daily fees**. Raydium, the primary DEX for these launches, has seen its 30-day revenue climb as it captures the trading volume of successful tokens.\n*   **Catalysts:** \n    *   **Low Barrier to Entry:** Pump.fun simplified token creation to a \"one-click\" process, leading to thousands of daily launches.\n    *   **Speculative Frenzy:** The \"celebrity coin\" meta and the viral nature of memecoins on Solana have sustained high transaction volumes despite market volatility.\n\n### 2. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins & Synthetic Dollars\nAs investors seek \"real yield\" outside of simple staking, protocols that generate revenue from market inefficiencies (delta-neutral strategies) have surged.\n*   **Key Protocols:** **Ethena (USDe)** and **Mountain Protocol**.\n*   **Performance:** Ethena has seen rapid TVL and revenue growth, recently surpassing major DeFi incumbents in monthly revenue generation. It captures the \"basis trade\" (the spread between spot and futures prices).\n*   **Catalysts:** \n    *   **High Yield Environment:** USDe’s ability to offer 20-30%+ yields during bullish funding environments has drawn massive capital.\n    *   **Exchange Integrations:** Partnerships with major CEXs (like Bybit) to use USDe as collateral have significantly boosted its utility and supply.\n\n### 3. High-Throughput Layer 2s (L2)\nWhile the Dencun upgrade (March 2024) drastically reduced fees for users, the *volume* on specific L2s has grown so much that their total revenue remains high or growing.\n*   **Key Protocols:** **Base** and **Arbitrum**.\n*   **Performance:** Base (Coinbase’s L2) has outperformed most other L2s in revenue growth over the last 30 days, driven by a surge in social and consumer applications.\n*   **Catalysts:** \n    *   **SocialFi Integration:** The growth of **Farcaster** and its client **Warpcast** (which runs largely on Base) has created a unique, sticky user base.\n    *   **Coinbase On-ramps:** Base benefits from seamless integration with Coinbase’s 100M+ users, making it the default choice for retail-focused DeFi and NFT mints.\n\n### 4. Liquid Restaking (LRTs)\nThe transition from simple staking to \"restaking\" has created a new layer of fee generation.\n*   **Key Protocols:** **Ether.fi**, **Renzo**, and **EigenLayer**.\n*   **Performance:** These protocols have seen some of the highest 30-day TVL inflows in the industry. While much of the \"revenue\" is currently accrued in points or pre-market value, the actual fees paid to these protocols for securing \"Actively Validated Services\" (AVSs) are starting to scale.\n*   **Catalysts:** \n    *   **Airdrop Incentives:** The \"points meta\" continues to drive users to lock up ETH to qualify for multiple potential airdrops (EigenLayer + LRT protocol).\n    *   **Mainnet Launches:** The gradual rollout of EigenLayer’s mainnet and its AVSs is beginning to transition the sector from speculation to functional revenue.\n\n### Summary Table: 30-Day Revenue Leaders\n| Sector | Key Protocol | Driver |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Memecoins** | Pump.fun | 1% launch/graduation fee on thousands of daily tokens. |\n| **DEX (Solana)** | Raydium | Massive volume from Solana memecoin trading. |\n| **L2 (Ethereum)** | Base | Farcaster activity and retail memecoin season. |\n| **DeFi Yield** | Ethena | Basis trade revenue from high funding rates. |\n| **Lending** | Aave | Increased borrowing demand for leveraged yield farming. |",
