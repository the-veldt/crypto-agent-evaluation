Avalanche (Ava Labs) – $250 Million\n*   **Sector:** Layer 1 Blockchain / Infrastructure\n*   **Date:** December 12, 2024\n*   **Lead Investors:** Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, ParaFi Capital\n*   **Details:** The Avalanche Foundation closed a $250 million private token sale to over 40 investment firms. The funds are earmarked for the **Avalanche9000** upgrade, which aims to reduce the cost of launching new blockchains (L1s) on the network by up to 99.9%.\n\n### 2. 0G Labs (Zero Gravity Labs) – $290 Million\n*   **Sector:** AI / Infrastructure\n*   **Date:** November 13, 2024\n*   **Lead Investors:** Hack VC, Delphi Digital, OKX Ventures\n*   **Details:** 0G Labs raised a massive total of $290 million, consisting of a $40 million seed round and a $250 million commitment for future token purchases. They are building a **Decentralized AI Operating System (dAIOS)** to provide high-performance data storage and execution for AI applications on-chain.\n\n### 3. MARA (Marathon Digital) – $1 Billion\n*   **Sector:** Mining / Bitcoin Infrastructure\n*   **Date:** November 2024\n*   **Type:** Convertible Bond Issuance\n*   **Details:** While a public company, MARA’s $1 billion raise is one of the largest capital inflows into the crypto ecosystem this year. The company intends to use the proceeds primarily to acquire more Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, reinforcing the \"Bitcoin Treasury\" trend.\n\n### 4. usdx.money – $45 Million\n*   **Sector:** Stablecoins / DeFi\n*   **Date:** November 29, 2024\n*   **Lead Investors:** NGC Ventures, BAI Capital, Generative Ventures\n*   **Details:** This stablecoin issuer raised $45 million at a $275 million valuation. The project focuses on creating a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem and intends to use the capital to accelerate its growth and integration across DeFi protocols.\n\n### 5. Nano Labs – $36.25 Million\n*   **Sector:** Infrastructure / Mining Hardware\n*   **Date:** December 2024\n*   **Details:** Nano Labs secured over $36 million in private funding to support its development of high-performance computing (HPC) chips and infrastructure, specifically targeting the intersection of crypto mining and AI processing.\n\n---\n\n### Notable Mid-Size Rounds (Last 30 Days)\n*   **Klickl ($25M):** A Series A round for a crypto payment and CEX platform focused on bridging traditional finance and Web3.\n*   **Glow ($30M):** An Ethereum-based DePIN project focused on decentralized solar energy production.\n*   **Noble ($15M):** An asset issuance chain in the Cosmos ecosystem, which raised funds to expand its institutional-grade stablecoin issuance.\n*   **Exabits ($15M):** A \"Crypto-AI\" startup that tokenizes GPU power to decentralize cloud computing.\n\n### Key Trends Observed:\n1.  **AI & Infrastructure Dominance:** Investors are heavily favoring projects that bridge AI and blockchain (0G Labs, Exabits).\n2.  **Institutional Layer 1 Confidence:** The Avalanche raise signals that VCs are still willing to place massive bets on established ecosystems that are evolving their tech stack.\n3.  **Bitcoin Synergy:** Between MARA's raise and the rise of Bitcoin L2s, capital is increasingly flowing into projects that leverage or support the Bitcoin network.",
