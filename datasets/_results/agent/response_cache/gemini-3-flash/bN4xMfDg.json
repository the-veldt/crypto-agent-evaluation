It recently topped \"Trending\" lists with a price increase of over **70-80%** and thousands of new unique wallet addresses interacting with the pair.\n*   **Degen Spartan AI (DEGENAI):** Another key player in the AI meta, showing high growth in \"unique makers\" as traders speculate on the next wave of autonomous trading agents.\n\n### 2. Story (IP)\n**Story Protocol (IP)** has recently experienced a major spike in trader count. As a relatively new and highly anticipated asset, it has consistently appeared at the top of BitScreener and DexScreener’s trending lists for the last several hours, specifically for high volume and an increase in new individual wallets (traders) entering the market.\n\n### 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE)\nSince its recent launch and ongoing adoption, **HYPE** continues to be a leader in attracting new traders. Because it is the native token of the Hyperliquid L1/DEX—which is currently a hub for \"new trader\" activity—it often sees high growth in unique addresses during periods of market volatility.\n\n### 4. Solana \"Pump\" Tokens (Micro-caps)\nOn Solana, the \"New Pairs\" section of DexScreener frequently shows tokens with the highest *percentage* growth in new traders. \n*   **Current Trending:** Tokens like **ANALOG (ANLOG)** and **AA (Account Abstraction Incentive)** have shown significant spikes in unique buyer counts within the last 4 hours, often outperforming established large caps in terms of trader growth percentage.\n\n### Summary of Metrics (Last 4 Hours)\n| Asset | Meta / Category | Growth Driver |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **ELIZAOS** | AI Agents / Memecoin | Breakdown of new AI framework adoption. |\n| **IP (Story)** | Infrastructure / IP | High-profile new listing and volume surge. |\n| **HYPE** | Perpetual DEX / L1 | Native ecosystem growth and trader incentives. |\n| **DEGENAI** | AI Agent | Speculative inflow into AI-trading niche. |\n\n**Note:** Growth in \"new traders\" for micro-cap assets is extremely volatile. If you are looking for these assets on a screener, the **\"Unique Makers\"** column on DexScreener (filtered for 1H or 6H) is the most accurate live indicator of where new hands are entering the market.",
