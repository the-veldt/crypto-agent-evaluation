Twitter will become an “everything app,” rebranding as X. \n \n Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said, “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.”  \n This sudden change by the enigmatic owner has created a stir in the market.  \n Musk’s decision to rebrand Twitter and pivot away from its roots requires us to question the infallibility of major social media networks and how we use them in our marketing strategies. Let’s chew on these questions:  \n \n What should we do next?  \n How much control do we have over our marketing assets?  \n \n It’s difficult to say what the future of individual social media platforms will be. Ahead of Twitter’s rebranding, Musk made a series of changes to the app. Twitter users were limited to seeing only a few hundred tweets per day. Users reported glitches, site outages, and other UX issues. \n For many businesses using Twitter, these critical usability issues have inhibited their ability to reach their customers. This, along with other concerns with the platform, led to an advertising exodus, with this spring’s ad revenue dropping 59% compared to the previous year. \n There’s an appetite to ditch the chaos to find a safer, more controllable asset. One of the most notable competitors is Meta’s introduction of Threads. However, a few missing Threads features may have contributed to a 50% drop in users within its first week. \n Mark Zuckerburg is confident in the product despite the drop "

The query likely seeks real-time or recent data on which stocks or cryptocurrencies are trending on X (Twitter). The search engine instead returned academic definitions of assets, regulatory reports on digital currencies, and business case studies about Twitter's valuation.

Twitter will become an “everything app,” rebranding as X. \\n \\n Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said, “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.”  \\n This sudden change by the enigmatic owner has created a stir in the market.  \\n Musk’s decision to rebrand Twitter and pivot away from its roots requires us to question the infallibility of major social media networks and how we use them in our marketing strategies. Let’s chew on these questions:  \\n \\n What should we do next?  \\n How much control do we have over our marketing assets?  \\n \\n It’s difficult to say what the future of individual social media platforms will be. Ahead of Twitter’s rebranding, Musk made a series of changes to the app. Twitter users were limited to seeing only a few hundred tweets per day. Users reported glitches, site outages, and other UX issues. \\n For many businesses using Twitter, these critical usability issues have inhibited their ability to reach their customers. This, along with other concerns with the platform, led to an advertising exodus, with this spring’s ad revenue dropping 59% compared to the previous year. \\n There’s an appetite to ditch the chaos to find a safer, more controllable asset. One of the most notable competitors is Meta’s introduction of Threads. However, a few missing Threads features may have contributed to a 50% drop in users within its first week. \\n Mark Zuckerburg is confident in the product despite the drop \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/november-2025-financial-stability-report-asset-valuations.htm\",\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"text\": \"The Fed - 1.

Tokenizing these items translates them into digital form, allowing them to be divided between multiple owners and making it easier to trade them.\\n## [](#what-are-rwas)What are RWAs?\\nSome RWAs are tangible—items you can see and touch, such as gold bars or commercial buildings. Others are intangible, such as government debt, intellectual property, or equity in a company.\\nWhen tokenized, these assets are turned into units of value. Tokenized gold is a good example of how this works. The company[Paxosopens in a new tab](https://www.paxos.com/)translates 400-ounce gold bars into 400 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, each backed by one ounce of gold. Token-holders can redeem their tokens for gold at any point.

Today, we’re excited to announce a major step in that direction:\n\n**From now on, all new listings across spot, futures, perpetual futures, and more, will be announced from one official channel: the newly rebranded** [**@CoinbaseMarkets**](https://x.com/CoinbaseMarkets) **handle on X.**\n\n## What’s Changing?\n\nUntil now, asset listings have been announced across multiple Coinbase social handles, often tied to specific platforms like Coinbase Exchange, Coinbase International Exchange, or Coinbase Advanced. This made it harder to track new listings, especially as our product lineup has grown.\n\nGoing forward:\n\nOne central handle, [**@CoinbaseMarkets**](https://x.com/CoinbaseMarkets), will be the single source of truth for all listing announcements.\n\nEach post will highlight the product type (spot, perps, futures, etc.) and include a thread with details on eligibility, platform access, and how to start trading.\n\nIn addition to listings, followers can expect market insights, trends, and trading data.\n\nThis change is designed to make your trading experience smoother and more informed, ensuring you know what we are listing, when it’s available, and where it can be traded.\n\nThis is more than just a communications change,  it’s a foundation for our long-term vision as Coinbase builds an everything exchange. Centralizing our listings announcements ensures that as we grow, you can easily keep track of new opportunities — no matter how diverse our product lineup becomes.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nFollow [**@CoinbaseMarkets**](https://x.com/CoinbaseMarkets) **on X** today to stay ahead of every launch. In the coming months, you can expect:\n\nMore product variety than ever before.\n\nDeeper market insights and trading data alongside listings.\n\nA more consistent, transparent, and trader-first communication style.\n\nThis is just the beginning.

The cluster divides itself into layers\nof nodes, and each node in a given layer is responsible for propagating any data\nit receives on to a small set of nodes in the next downstream layer. This way\neach node only has to communicate with a small number of nodes.\n## Layer Structure[​](#layer-structure)\nThe leader communicates with a special root node. The root can be thought of as\nlayer 0 and communicates with layer 1, which is made up of at most`DATA\\_PLANE\\_FANOUT`nodes. If the number of nodes in the cluster is greater than\nlayer 1, then the data plane fanout mechanism adds layers below. The number of\nnodes in each additional layer grows by a factor of`DATA\\_PLANE\\_FANOUT`.\nA good way to think about this is, layer 0 starts with a single node, layer 1\nstarts with fanout nodes, and layer 2 will have`fanout \\* number of nodes in\nlayer 1`and so on.\n### Layer Assignment - Weighted Selection[​](#layer-assignment----weighted-selection)\nIn order for data plane fanout to work, the entire cluster must agree on how the\ncluster is divided into layers. To achieve this, all the recognized validator\nnodes(the TVU peers)are shuffled with a stake weighting and stored in a\nlist. This list is then indexed in different ways to figure out layer boundaries\nand retransmit peers - referred to as the(turbine tree). For example, the\nlist is shuffled and leader selects the first node to be the root node, and the\nroot node selects the next`DATA\\_PLANE\\_FANOUT`nodes to make up layer 1. The\nshuffle is biased towards higher staked nodes, allowing heavier votes to come\nback to the leader first. Layer 2 and lower-layer nodes use the same logic to\nfind their next layer peers.\nTo reduce the possibility of attack vectors, the list is shuffl"

This process usually happens sequentially or is flooded. However, this method is not scalable, as it becomes difficult to manage as the network grows due to the sheer number of communications.\nLet’s consider a network of 35,000 validators. The leader needs to transmit a 128 MB block (about 500,000 transactions at 250 bytes per transaction) to all 35,000 validators. The traditional block propagation implementation would require the leader to have a unique connection to each validator and transmit the full 128 MB 35,000 times. This would result in a total data transmission of 4.69 TB, which is far beyond typical bandwidth capabilities and would be infeasible to accommodate with so many connections.\nTo solve the issue of slow block dissemination, Solana introduced Turbine, a multi-layer block propagation mechanism used by clusters to broadcast ledger entries to all nodes. Broadly speaking, Turbine breaks blocks into smaller blocks and disseminates them through an order of nodes, reducing the load on an individual nod"

The root can be thought of as\nlayer 0 and communicates with layer 1, which is made up of at most`DATA\\_PLANE\\_FANOUT`nodes. If the number of nodes in the cluster is greater than\nlayer 1, then the data plane fanout mechanism adds layers below.

For example, the\nlist is shuffled and leader selects the first node to be the root node, and the\nroot node selects the next`DATA\\_PLANE\\_FANOUT`nodes to make up layer 1.

In traditional blockchain networks, this process faces several challenges and limitations. Firstly, the speed of data propagation is often slow, leading to network congestion and increased confirmation times. Secondly, as transaction volumes increase, traditional networks struggle to handle the increased load efficiently. These challenges hinder scalability and decentralization, essential aspects of blockchain technology.\n## Introducing Solana Blockchain\nSolana is a next-generation blockchain platform designed for scalability and performance.

Block propagation is the process by which a newly produced block travels across a peer-to-peer network so that honest nodes converge on the same chain view quickly. The speed, reliability, and consistency of propagation shape user experience, validator incentives, decentralized finance (DeFi) safety, and even the revenue of miners and stakers across networks like[Bitcoin (BTC)](https://www.cube.exchange/what-is/bitcoin)and[Ethereum (ETH)](https://www.cube.exchange/what-is/ethereum). Faster propagation reduces the chance of temporary forks, "

This process usually happens sequentially or is flooded. However, this method is not scalable, as it becomes difficult to manage as the network grows due to the sheer number of communications.\\nLet’s consider a network of 35,000 validators. The leader needs to transmit a 128 MB block (about 500,000 transactions at 250 bytes per transaction) to all 35,000 validators. The traditional block propagation implementation would require the leader to have a unique connection to each validator and transmit the full 128 MB 35,000 times. This would result in a total data transmission of 4.69 TB, which is far beyond typical bandwidth capabilities and would be infeasible to accommodate with so many connections.\\nTo solve the issue of slow block dissemination, Solana introduced Turbine, a multi-layer block propagation mechanism used by clusters to broadcast ledger entries to all nodes. Broadly speaking, Turbine breaks blocks into smaller blocks and disseminates them through an order of nodes, reducing the load on an individual nod\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Solana Turbine Notes\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.italo.dev/blog/solana-turbine-notes\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2024-08-03T08:21:29.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"My Portfolio\",\n    \"text\": \"Italo Casas Blog\\n# Solana Turbine Notes\\nAugust 3, 2024\\n* [https://www.helius.dev/blog/turbine-block-propagation-on-solana](https://www.helius.dev/blog/turbine-block-propagation-on-solana)\\n* [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/\\\\~tessaro/papers/dds.pdf](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/papers/dds.pdf)\\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04371)\\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon\\\\_error\\\\_correction\\n* https://docs.anza.xyz/consensus/turbine-block-propagation#layer-assignment----weighted-selection\\nTurbine is Solana&#x27;s Block propagation mechanism, allowing all validators to receive the most updated state promptly\\nTurbine was specifically designed to mitigate the stress of egress from the leader to the network.\\nAt a high level, the turbine breaks blocks into smaller chunks (shreds) and sends those shreds through a hierarchy of nodes.\\n* Confirmed block: Super majority\\n* Finalized block: Confirmed and 31+ confirmed block built on top.### [](#shred-propagation)Shred propagation\\n1.

The root can be thought of as\\nlayer 0 and communicates with layer 1, which is made up of at most`DATA\\\\_PLANE\\\\_FANOUT`nodes. If the number of nodes in the cluster is greater than\\nlayer 1, then the data plane fanout mechanism adds layers below.

For example, the\\nlist is shuffled and leader selects the first node to be the root node, and the\\nroot node selects the next`DATA\\\\_PLANE\\\\_FANOUT`nodes to make up layer 1.

However, the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks have been persistent challenges. Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform, aims to address these challenges with its innovative data propagation solution, Turbine. In this article, we delve into the details of Turbine and explore how it revolutionizes blockchain data propagation.\\n![Solana&#039;s Turbine: Revolutionizing Blockchain Data Propagation](https://astconsulting.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canva-designs-2023-07-12T154830.496.jpg)## Understanding Blockchain Data Propagation\\nBlockchain data propagation refers to the process of transmitting data across the network of nodes that validate and maintain the blockchain. In traditional blockchain networks, this process faces several challenges and limitations. Firstly, the speed of data propagation is often slow, leading to network congestion and increased confirmation times. Secondly, as transaction volumes increase, traditional networks struggle to handle the increased load efficiently.

A comprehensive, fact-checked guide to how new blocks travel across blockchain networks, why propagation speed matters for security and DeFi, and how leading chains optimize it.\\\")\\n## Introduction\\nIf you have ever asked what is Block Propagation and why it matters, you are already close to understanding a core performance and security factor in every public blockchain. Block propagation is the process by which a newly produced block travels across a peer-to-peer network so that honest nodes converge on the same chain view quickly. The speed, reliability, and consistency of propagation shape user experience, validator incentives, decentralized finance (DeFi) safety, and even the revenue of miners and stakers across networks like[Bitcoin (BTC)](https://www.cube.exchange/what-is/bitcoin)and[Ethereum (ETH)](https://www.cube.exchange/what-is/ethereum). Faster propagation reduces the chance of temporary forks, \"\n  }\n]\n\nExecution Time: 1960.10ms\nSearch Parameters: {\n  \"query\": \"how does solana turbine block propagation work\",\n  \"numResults\": 15,\n  \"includeText\": true,\n  \"maxCharacters\": 2000\n}"
