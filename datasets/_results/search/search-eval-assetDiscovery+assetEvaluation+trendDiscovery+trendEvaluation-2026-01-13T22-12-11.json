The underlying architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX. Building in the Solana Ecosytem? Check out our [Solana Data API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/solana)"

The underlying architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX. Building in the Solana Ecosytem?

Tokenizing these items translates them into digital form, allowing them to be divided between multiple owners and making it easier to trade them.\n## [](#what-are-rwas)What are RWAs?\nSome RWAs are tangible—items you can see and touch, such as gold bars or commercial buildings. Others are intangible, such as government debt, intellectual property, or equity in a company.\nWhen tokenized, these assets are turned into units of value. Tokenized gold is a good example of how this works.

Token-holders can redeem their tokens for gold at any point. That’s also the case for tokens purchased from another RWA company,[Tether Goldopens in a new tab](https://gold.tether.to/).\nEach token can be divided into even smaller fractions. Tether Gold tokens, for instance, can be split into parts as small as 0.000001.\nRWA tokens don’t have any intrinsic value. Rather, they reflect the value of the item that the"

              "text": "[Watch CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/live/)\n\nThe so-called Twitter Files are the brainchild of Twitter owner Elon Musk, who has said he wants to show \"what really happened\" behind the scenes regarding content moderation decisions at the social media company before he bought it in October.\n\nThe Twitter Files have been released in dribs and drabs throughout December, with three journalists — Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger — delving into the internal documents and discussions to highlight the company's decision-making process around some high-profile actions, such as banning former President Donald Trump in January 2020.\n\nUnder Musk, who has said he wants Twitter to be a mecca for free speech, the company has [reinstated some previously banned accounts](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-accounts-reinstated-elon-musk-donald-trump-kanye-ye-jordan-peterson-kathy-griffin-andrew-tate/), such as those belonging to Trump and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. (Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, was [reinstated](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kanye-west-twitter-account-returns-elon-musk/) but then [banned again](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kanye-west-suspended-from-twitter-again-elon-musk/) less than two weeks later.) Musk has been critical of the prior management's content moderation decisions, arguing that they engaged in censorship.\n\nHere's what to know about the Twitter Files and what they reveal.\n\n## What are the Twitter Files?\n\nThe Twitter Files consist of thousands of internal documents, including many Slack discussions, between Twitter employees about their content moderation decisions.\n\nSo far, there have been five releases from the Twitter Files, each focusing on a different facet of Twitter's content moderation.\n\n- [Twitter Files Part 1](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394?t=2c6hbUzovHaWgkadt-vTEA&s=19) focuses on the company's decisions surrounding news about material found on what is alleged to be Hunter Bi"

Crypto hasn&#8217;t caught up just yet. Yield-generating assets make up just**8-11%**of crypto markets versus**55-65%**of TradFi. That&#8217;s a**5-6x**development gap, but yield bearing assets are positioned for significant growth as the &#8220;Crypto-as-Infrastructure&#8221; thesis gains traction.\n* The GENIUS Act is being called the most significant catalyst for crypto since the Bitcoin whitepaper. The timing couldn&#8217;t be better. As clarity emerges, yield bearing stablecoins are exploding: market capitalization is up**300% YoY**, with new protocols launching monthly to capture the opportunity.\n* Blue-chip yield products are gaining major momentum. ETH liquid staking tokens (LSTs) surged from 6 million to 16 million between 2023 and November 2025, adding**$34 billion**in notional value at current prices. SOL LSTs doubled over the same period, adding**$10 billion**in market cap. Meanwhile, Bitcoin yield products are emerging as the next frontier.\n* **Yield bearing Real-World Assets (RWAs**) are bridging TradFi and onchain finance. Traditional institutions recognize the efficiency gains and are accelerating tokenization efforts. Beyond stablecoins, Private Credit and US Treasuries are leading the charge, capturing the largest capital inflows across all tokenized asset categories.\n* **DeFi runs on yield bearing assets (YBAs)**. ETH and SOL LSTs alone account for ro"

Crypto hasn&#8217;t caught up just yet. Yield-generating assets make up just**8-11%**of crypto markets versus**55-65%**of TradFi. That&#8217;s a**5-6x**development gap, but yield bearing assets are positioned for significant growth as the &#8220;Crypto-as-Infrastructure&#8221; thesis gains traction.\\n* The GENIUS Act is being called the most significant catalyst for crypto since the Bitcoin whitepaper. The timing couldn&#8217;t be better. As clarity emerges, yield bearing stablecoins are exploding: market capitalization is up**300% YoY**, with new protocols launching monthly to capture the opportunity.\\n* Blue-chip yield products are gaining major momentum. ETH liquid staking tokens (LSTs) surged from 6 million to 16 million between 2023 and November 2025, adding**$34 billion**in notional value at current prices. SOL LSTs doubled over the same period, adding**$10 billion**in market cap. Meanwhile, Bitcoin yield products are emerging as the next frontier.\\n* **Yield bearing Real-World Assets (RWAs**) are bridging TradFi and onchain finance. Traditional institutions recognize the efficiency gains and are accelerating tokenization efforts. Beyond stablecoins, Private Credit and US Treasuries are leading the charge, capturing the largest capital inflows across all tokenized asset categories.\\n* **DeFi runs on yield bearing assets (YBAs)**.

That creates information gaps, privileges a few players, and can leave markets thin and unstable. We think there is a better way. CCA was designed around three core principles:\n* **Onchain-native market creation.**The entire auction runs onchain, with pricing, bidding, and settlement happening transparently. No gatekeepers or offchain deals.\n* **Fair, gradual price discovery.**Supply is distributed over time through a continuous clearing process. This incentivizes bidding early, reduces sniping, limits volatility, and helps the market converge toward a fair value.\n* **Automatic liquidity seeding on Uniswap v4.**When the auction ends, proceeds automatically create a Uniswap v4 pool at the discovered price, deepening liquidity.## [](https://blog.uniswap.org/continuous-clearing-auctions#how-it-works)How it works\n**Setting up the auction**\nProjects start off by defining how many tokens to sell, a starting pr"

Exploring the Cardinal Protocol Revolution\n\nCardano has taken a bold step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with the launch of the Cardinal Protocol, a groundbreaking innovation that bridges Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano’s ecosystem. This development not only positions Cardano as a key player in the DeFi sector but also introduces Bitcoin holders to a trust-minimized, decentralized way to engage with DeFi services.\n\n### What Makes Cardano DeFi?\n\nCardano’s DeFi ecosystem has been steadily growing, but the introduction of the Cardinal Protocol marks a significant milestone. Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that rely on centralized custodians or federated systems, Cardinal leverages advanced cryptographic methods to ensure decentralization and security. This makes Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem unique and attractive to Bitcoin holders seeking decentralized solutions.\n\n### The Cardinal Protocol: Bridging Bitcoin to Cardano\n\nThe Cardinal Protocol enables Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to be wrapped into transferable tokens on the Cardano blockchain. These wrapped tokens maintain a strict one-to-one peg with their original Bitcoin counterpart, ensuring that users can redeem their Bitcoin at any time. This process is facilitated by MuSig2, a multi-signature cryptographic protocol that enhances security and decentralization.\n\n#### Key Fea"

Certain services and features may not be available in your jurisdiction.\n\n## Introduction to Haedal Protocol and Its Impact on Sui Blockchain\n\nHaedal Protocol is making waves in the cryptocurrency world by offering a unique liquid staking solution on the Sui blockchain. Launched on Binance Alpha in April 2025, Haedal Protocol allows users to stake their SUI tokens while maintaining liquidity through yield-bearing haSUI tokens. This innovative approach not only enhances capital efficiency but also integrates deeply with the Sui DeFi ecosystem, providing users with multiple avenues to maximize their returns.\n\n## How Haedal Protocol Works: Liquid Staking Explained\n\nAt the core of Haedal Protocol is its liquid staking mechanism. Users can stake their SUI tokens and receive haSUI tokens in return. These haSUI tokens represent the staked assets and accumulate yield over time. The value of haSUI is determined by the formula:\n\n**haSUI Price = Total Staked SUI / Total haSUI in Circulation**\n\nThis ensures that as more SUI is staked, the value of haSUI increases, providing long-term holders with potential value appreciation. Moreover, haSUI tokens can be used across various DeFi applications within the Sui ecosystem, allowing users to earn additional rewards.\n\n## Key Features of Haedal Protocol\n\n### Liquid Staking with haSUI\n\nHaedal Protocol's liquid staking model allows users to keep their assets productive even while staked. By receiving haSUI tokens, users can continue participating in DeFi activities, such as providing liquidity on Cetus DEX or engaging in lending and borrowing on platforms like Scallop.\n\n### Governance and Utility of $HAEDAL\n\nThe native token, $HAEDAL, plays a crucial role in the protocol's governance and utility. Token holders can participate in decision-making processes through HaeDAO, influencing key aspects like treasury management and reward distribution. Additionally, $HAEDAL can be used to boost yields in"

Exploring the Cardinal Protocol Revolution\\n\\nCardano has taken a bold step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with the launch of the Cardinal Protocol, a groundbreaking innovation that bridges Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano’s ecosystem. This development not only positions Cardano as a key player in the DeFi sector but also introduces Bitcoin holders to a trust-minimized, decentralized way to engage with DeFi services.\\n\\n### What Makes Cardano DeFi?\\n\\nCardano’s DeFi ecosystem has been steadily growing, but the introduction of the Cardinal Protocol marks a significant milestone. Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that rely on centralized custodians or federated systems, Cardinal leverages advanced cryptographic methods to ensure decentralization and security. This makes Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem unique and attractive to Bitcoin holders seeking decentralized solutions.\\n\\n### The Cardinal Protocol: Bridging Bitcoin to Cardano\\n\\nThe Cardinal Protocol enables Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to be wrapped into transferable tokens on the Cardano blockchain. These wrapped tokens maintain a strict one-to-one peg with their original Bitcoin counterpart, ensuring that users can redeem their Bitcoin at any time. This process is facilitated by MuSig2, a multi-signature cryptographic protocol that enhances security and decentralization.\\n\\n#### Key Fea\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Haedal Protocol: Revolutionizing Liquid Staking on the Sui Blockchain\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.okx.com/learn/haedal-protocol-liquid-staking-sui\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"OKX\",\n    \"text\": \"This page is for information purposes only. Certain services and features may not be available in your jurisdiction.\\n\\n## Introduction to Haedal Protocol and Its Impact on Sui Blockchain\\n\\nHaedal Protocol is making waves in the cryptocurrency world by offering a unique liquid staking solution on the Sui blockchain. Launched on Binance Alpha in April 2025, Haedal Protocol allows users to stake their SUI tokens while maintaining liquidity through yield-bearing haSUI tokens. This innovative approach not only enhances capital efficiency but also integrates deeply with the Sui DeFi ecosystem, providing users with multiple avenues to maximize their returns.\\n\\n## How Haedal Protocol Works: Liquid Staking Explained\\n\\nAt the core of Haedal Protocol is its liquid staking mechanism. Users can stake their SUI tokens and receive haSUI tokens in return. These haSUI tokens represent the staked assets and accumulate yield over time. The value of haSUI is determined by the formula:\\n\\n**haSUI Price = Total Staked SUI / Total haSUI in Circulation**\\n\\nThis ensures that as more SUI is staked, the value of haSUI increases, providing long-term holders with potential value appreciation. Moreover, haSUI tokens can be used across various DeFi applications within the Sui ecosystem, allowing users to earn additional rewards.\\n\\n## Key Features of Haedal Protocol\\n\\n### Liquid Staking with haSUI\\n\\nHaedal Protocol's liquid staking model allows users to keep their assets productive even while staked. By receiving haSUI tokens, users can continue participating in DeFi activities, such as providing liquidity on Cetus DEX or engaging in lending and borrowing on platforms like Scallop.\\n\\n### Governance and Utility of $HAEDAL\\n\\nThe native token, $HAEDAL, plays a crucial role in the protocol's governance and utility. Token holders can participate in decision-making processes through HaeDAO, influencing key aspects like treasury management and reward distribution. Additionally, $HAEDAL can be used to boost yields in\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Morpho Token Lending: Unlocking DeFi Potential with $10 Billion Milestone\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.okx.com/en-us/learn/morpho-token-lending-defi-milestone\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-08-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"OKX\",\n    \"text\": \"This page is for information purposes only.

Each leader has six blocks labeled L1-1 to L1-6, L2-1 to L2-6, and L3-1 to L3-6 respectively. The red nodes are connected to a central 'Consensus Leader' node, which is purple. The Consensus Leader then connects to four validators (V1 to V4), represented by blue ovals. The diagram shows the flow of information with arrows indicating the connections between leaders, red nodes, the consensus leader, and validators. The packed block is shown in a blue rectangle below the Consensus Leader, containing data from each leader's blocks. The diagram also includes 'IHAVE' labels on the lines connecting the red nodes to the Consensus Leader, indicating the data transfer process. The diagram is a visual representation of the Solana Turbine's block propagation mechanism.",

This process usually happens sequentially or is flooded. However, this method is not scalable, as it becomes difficult to manage as the network grows due to the sheer number of communications.\nLet’s consider a network of 35,000 validators. The leader needs to transmit a 128 MB block (about 500,000 transactions at 250 bytes per transaction) to all 35,000 validators. The traditional block propagation implementation would require the leader to have a unique connection to each validator and transmit the full 128 MB 35,000 times. This would result in a total data transmission of 4.69 TB, which is far beyond typical bandwidth capabilities and would be infeasible to accommodate with so many connections.\nTo solve the issue of slow block dissemination, Solana introduced Turbine, a multi-layer block propagation mechanism used by clusters to broadcast ledger entries to all nodes. Broadly speaking, Turbine breaks blocks into smaller blocks and disseminates them through an order of nodes, reducing the load on an individual nod"

However, the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks have been persistent challenges. Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform, aims to address these challenges with its innovative data propagation solution, Turbine. In this article, we delve into the details of Turbine and explore how it revolutionizes blockchain data propagation.\n![Solana&#039;s Turbine: Revolutionizing Blockchain Data Propagation](https://astconsulting.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canva-designs-2023-07-12T154830.496.jpg)## Understanding Blockchain Data Propagation\nBlockchain data propagation refers to the process of transmitting data across the network of nodes that validate and maintain the blockchain. In traditional blockchain networks, this process faces several challenges and limitations. Firstly, the speed of data propagation is often slow, leading to network congestion and increased confirmation times. Secondly, as transaction volumes increase, traditional networks struggle to handle the increased load efficiently. These challenges hinder scalability and decentralization, essential aspects of blockchain technology.\n## Introducing Solana Blockchain\nSolana is a next-generation blockchain platform designed for scalability and performance.

It ensures that all necessary information is readily accessible to nodes for validation purposes, which maintains the integrity and security of the network. However, ensuring data availability while maintaining a high level of performance is a significant challenge, especially as networks scale.\nSolana has risen to this challenge with a unique architectural design that facilitates continuous block creation and propagation. This is made possible through several key innovations such as leader selection, Gulf Stream (eliminates the need for a mempool), and Turbine (block propagation mechanism).\nThe continuous nature of Solana necessitates an efficient system to ensure that all validators receive the most updated state promptly. A simplistic approach would have the leader transmit all blocks directly to every other validator. Yet, given Solana’s high throughput, this method would significantly bloat bandwidth and other resource requirements while undermining decentralization.\nBandwidth is a scarce resource, and Turbine is Solana’s ingenious solution to optimize information propagation from the leader of a given block to the rest of the network.**Turbine was specifically designed to mitigate the stress of egress (sending data out) from the leader to the network**.\nIn this article, we’ll dive into how Turbine works as well as its pivotal role in Solana’s broader landscape of transaction inclusion. We’ll also compare Turbine to other data avai"

This process usually happens sequentially or is flooded. However, this method is not scalable, as it becomes difficult to manage as the network grows due to the sheer number of communications.\\nLet’s consider a network of 35,000 validators. The leader needs to transmit a 128 MB block (about 500,000 transactions at 250 bytes per transaction) to all 35,000 validators. The traditional block propagation implementation would require the leader to have a unique connection to each validator and transmit the full 128 MB 35,000 times. This would result in a total data transmission of 4.69 TB, which is far beyond typical bandwidth capabilities and would be infeasible to accommodate with so many connections.\\nTo solve the issue of slow block dissemination, Solana introduced Turbine, a multi-layer block propagation mechanism used by clusters to broadcast ledger entries to all nodes. Broadly speaking, Turbine breaks blocks into smaller blocks and disseminates them through an order of nodes, reducing the load on an individual nod\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Turbine - Solana Handbook\",\n    \"url\": \"https://ackee.xyz/solana/book/latest/chapter2/turbine/\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"Ackee Blockchain Security\",\n    \"text\": \"Turbine\\n# Turbine\\nTurbine is a block propagation protocol designed to reduce both time needed for block propagation as well as the overall message complexity, reducing the communication overhead of a node.\\nNodes in the network are divided into small partitions called**neighborhoods**.

With 6 data shreds and 3 additional redundant shreds, we can lose up to 1/3 of the shreds and still be able to reconstruct the entire block fully.\\n* A**stake-weighted selection algorithm**is used to create a tree where the risk of faulty or malicious nodes is minimized.

However, the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks have been persistent challenges. Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform, aims to address these challenges with its innovative data propagation solution, Turbine. In this article, we delve into the details of Turbine and explore how it revolutionizes blockchain data propagation.\\n![Solana&#039;s Turbine: Revolutionizing Blockchain Data Propagation](https://astconsulting.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canva-designs-2023-07-12T154830.496.jpg)## Understanding Blockchain Data Propagation\\nBlockchain data propagation refers to the process of transmitting data across the network of nodes that validate and maintain the blockchain. In traditional blockchain networks, this process faces several challenges and limitations. Firstly, the speed of data propagation is often slow, leading to network congestion and increased confirmation times. Secondly, as transaction volumes increase, traditional networks struggle to handle the increased load efficiently. These challenges hinder scalability and decentralization, essential aspects of blockchain technology.\\n## Introducing Solana Blockchain\\nSolana is a next-generation blockchain platform designed for scalability and performance.

It ensures that all necessary information is readily accessible to nodes for validation purposes, which maintains the integrity and security of the network. However, ensuring data availability while maintaining a high level of performance is a significant challenge, especially as networks scale.\\nSolana has risen to this challenge with a unique architectural design that facilitates continuous block creation and propagation. This is made possible through several key innovations such as leader selection, Gulf Stream (eliminates the need for a mempool), and Turbine (block propagation mechanism).\\nThe continuous nature of Solana necessitates an efficient system to ensure that all validators receive the most updated state promptly. A simplistic approach would have the leader transmit all blocks directly to every other validator. Yet, given Solana’s high throughput, this method would significantly bloat bandwidth and other resource requirements while undermining decentralization.\\nBandwidth is a scarce resource, and Turbine is Solana’s ingenious solution to optimize information propagation from the leader of a given block to the rest of the network.**Turbine was specifically designed to mitigate the stress of egress (sending data out) from the leader to the network**.\\nIn this article, we’ll dive into how Turbine works as well as its pivotal role in Solana’s broader landscape of transaction inclusion.

A portion of yield from matured unredeemed PTs is distributed pro rata to vePENDLE holders. For example, matured PT-aUSDC is equivalent to aUSDC; if unredeemed, its yield is converted to a stablecoin and collected as protocol revenue, then distributed to vePENDLE holders. All rewards are converted to USDT and distributed periodically via a disbursement contract. Fees on points are applied similarly to how Pendle treats points as yield. Partner protocols deduct fees when allocating points to user wallets, and the fee wallets claim rewards, forwarding them to vePENDLE holders.",

Initially launched as a pure utility token, $PENDLE's role has evolved significantly. Over time, it has become crucial for value accumulation and protocol governance, setting the stage for Pendle's ongoing development and growth in tokenizing and trading future yield.\n\n**Token Distribution**\n\nPendle’s token distribution strategy focuses on decentralization and broad participation. Here’s how it breaks down:\n\n- **Liquidity Incentives**: A significant portion of tokens was allocated to incentivize liquidity, ensuring robust yield markets.\n\n- **Team**: These tokens, subject to a vesting schedule, align the team’s interests with the protocol’s long-term success.\n\n- **Investors and Advisors**: Early investors received tokens, but no single entity controls a substantial portion, with most holding less than 0.4% of the total supply. In the private round, investors can acquire $PENDLE for $0.14.\n\n- **Ecosystem Fund**: Reserved for future development and ecosystem growth.\n\n\nPendle doesn’t have a max supply cap. Its hybrid inflation model features weekly emissions that decrease by 1.1% each week until April 2026, when a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum, based on circulating supply, will take effect. At this point, all $PENDLE for team, investors, advisors, and ecosystem fund will have fully vested. The remaining tokens entering circulation will be for liquidity incentives.\n\n**Vesting Schedule and Emissions**\n\nCurrently in circulation is 156,16m of $PENDLE, while a total supply is 258,45m of $PENDLE.\n\n_Liquidity Incentives on all of the data charts above are projected until the end of the 2030s, based on an ass"

By utilizing vePENDLE, PENDLE holders gain access to an array of features that increase the token's utility.\n\nvePENDLE also serves as an additional sink for reducing the supply of PENDLE tokens, thereby increasing the token's stability and the overall robustness of the protocol. In this way, vePENDLE serves as an important tool for maintaining the long-term health and success of the Pendle ecosystem.\n\nHolding vePENDLE entitles you to:\n\n1. Vote to channel $PENDLE incentives into a pool\n2. Vote to receive Voter’s APY (80% of the swap fees of the voted pool)\n3. Receive base APY\n4. Boost LP rewards (up to 250%)\n\n## Getting vePENDLE [​](https://docs.pendle.finance/docs.pendle.finance\\#getting-vependle)\n\nLock PENDLE and receive vePENDLE. Your vePENDLE value is proportional to the amount and duration staked (up to a maximum of 2 years). Tutorial [here](https://docs.pendle.finance/pendle-v2/ProtocolMechanics/Mechanisms/Guides/Lock). Each wallet is associated with a single vePENDLE expiry date.\n\nYour vePENDLE value will decay over time, and reaches zero once the lock duration is over. Your staked PENDLE will then be unlocked.\n\nTo increase your vePENDLE value, you can choose to extend your staking duration and/or increase your staked amount.\n\n## Incentive Channelling [​](https://docs.pendle.finance/docs.pendle.finance\\#incentive-channelling)\n\nvePENDLE powers the incentive channeling mechanism on Pendle. vePENDLE holders vote for and direct the flow of rewards to different pools, effectively incentivizing liquidity in the pool they vote for.\n\nIntuitively, the higher your vePENDLE value, the more incentives you are entitled to channel.\n\nA snapshot of all votes is taken at the start of every epoch on Thursday, 00:00 UTC and the incen"

Pendle collects a 3% fee from all yield accrued via YT, 100% of which is re-distributed back to vePENDLE holders.\n- The protocol consists of the following major components working in conjunction:\n\n - **Yield Tokenization:** The underlying yield-bearing tokens are wrapped into SY (Standardized yield tokens) which is then split into the principal token (PT) and the yield component of it (YT).\n\n - **Pendle v2 AMM:** A capital efficient design model that is able to implement both PT and YT swaps (via flash swaps) using just a single pool of liquidity.\n- PENDLE has raised **$3.7m USD** in a seed round in Apr 2021, at 14.9% of the total supply with a **FDV at $35m USD.**\n\n- As at June 30, 2023, the total supply of PENDLE is 251 million PENDLE and the circulating supply is ~140 million (~56% of the total token supply.)\n\n- As of June 2023, the weekly emissions is about 460k. The emissions will gradually reduce by 1.10% weekly until April 2026. The current tokenomics allow for a terminal inflation rate of 2.00% per annum for incentives.\n\n- Learn more about the token "

Yield fluctuates just like token prices. It tends to go up in bull markets, and go down in bear markets, and there are further micro-factors that cause fluctuations within those general market trends.\n\nCompound historical yield charts from [The Block Crypto](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/cryptocurrency-lending/compound-lending-rates)\n\nWith Pendle, you can always maximise your yield: increase your yield exposure in bull markets and hedge against yield downturns during bear markets.\n\n## What does Pendle do? [​](https://docs.pendle.finance/docs.pendle.finance\\#what-does-pendle-do)\n\nWe give users the reins to their yield.\n\n[Pendle](https://pendle.finance/) is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies.\n\nThere are 3 main parts to fully understand Pendle:\n\n1. Yield Tokenization\n\nFirst, Pendle wrap **yield-bearing tokens** into **SY**(standardized yield tokens), which is a wrapped version of the underlying yield-bearing token that is compatible with the Pendle AMM (e.g. stETH → SY-stETH).\nSY is then split into its principal and yield components, **PT** (principal token) and **YT** (yield token) respectively, this process is termed as yield-tokenization, where the yield is tokenized into a separate token.\n\n2. Pendle AMM\n\nBoth **PT** and **YT** can be traded via Pendle’s **AMM**. Even though this is the core engine of Pendle, understanding of the AMM is not required to trade PT and YT.\n\n3. vePENDLE\n\n\nAs a yield derivative protocol, we are bringing the TradFi interest derivative market ( [worth over $400T in notional value](https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2111/intgraphs/graphA3.htm)) into DeFi, making it accessible to all.\n\nBy creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unloc"

Initially launched as a pure utility token, $PENDLE's role has evolved significantly. Over time, it has become crucial for value accumulation and protocol governance, setting the stage for Pendle's ongoing development and growth in tokenizing and trading future yield.\\n\\n**Token Distribution**\\n\\nPendle’s token distribution strategy focuses on decentralization and broad participation. Here’s how it breaks down:\\n\\n- **Liquidity Incentives**: A significant portion of tokens was allocated to incentivize liquidity, ensuring robust yield markets.\\n\\n- **Team**: These tokens, subject to a vesting schedule, align the team’s interests with the protocol’s long-term success.\\n\\n- **Investors and Advisors**: Early investors received tokens, but no single entity controls a substantial portion, with most holding less than 0.4% of the total supply. In the private round, investors can acquire $PENDLE for $0.14.\\n\\n- **Ecosystem Fund**: Reserved for future development and ecosystem growth.\\n\\n\\nPendle doesn’t have a max supply cap.

The data is sourced from Jito's MEV-boosted client adoption and its impact on Solana validators' performance. Two line graphs are displayed. The first graph compares the stake-weighted average uptime for validators running the Jito client (True) against those that are not (False), across epochs ranging from approximately 375 to 415. The uptime is measured on the y-axis, ranging from 95% to 100%. The Jito client consistently shows a higher uptime, generally around 99% to 100%, while the validators not running the Jito client fluctuate between approximately 98% and 99%. The second graph compares the stake-weighted average block production rate for validators running the Jito client (True) against those that are not (False), across the same epoch range. The block production rate is measured on the y-axis, ranging from 87.5% to 97.5%. The Jito client generally shows a higher block production rate, fluctuating between approximately 95% and 97.5%, while the validators not running the Jito client show more volatility, dipping below 90% at times."

The diagram shows a series of 'Keepers' (Keeper 1, Keeper 2, Keeper 3, up to Keeper N) at the top, which feed into a 'crank' mechanism. This crank then interacts with a system contained within a dashed yellow box, representing the StakeNet environment. Inside this environment, 'Validator History' feeds into 'Steward,' which in turn influences 'Delegation' and 'Scoring.' Another 'crank' mechanism connects the 'Steward' to the 'Stake Pool.' The image emphasizes that StakeNet involves a network of keepers, on-chain validator metadata, custom scoring and delegation logic, governance-adjustable parameters, and ensures no staker funds are at risk."

The relay then simulates and validates the block, and if valid, sends a 'block is valid' message back to the builder. The builder then receives a signed header from the proposer. The relay publishes the block to the EL client and CL client. The CL client then publishes the block to P2P. The process concludes with the relay sending a 'block published' message back to the builder. The diagram shows the interactions between the builder, relay, EL client, CL client, and P2P."

The text highlights two unique aspects of Jito's liquid staking token: it provides additional rewards from MEV transactions and exclusively stakes with validators that improve network performance.

Validators must uphold the contract outlined in BAM docs, including executing all received transactions in exact order and providing correct execution feedback and state information. These requirements are implemented by default in the BAM validator client. Modifications that breach this contract will result in removal from the subsidy program.

The image then describes validator eligibility, stating that validators do not need to be active Jito stake pool members, and the subsidy program extends to validators with a threshold stake of 50k SOL running the BAM client. Validators must uphold the contract outlined in BAM docs, including executing all received transactions in exact order and providing correct execution feedback and state information. These requirements are implemented by default in the BAM validator client. Modifications that breach this contract will result in removal from the subsidy program. Validators running BAM for at least 3 epochs will gain eligibility, and eligibility will be lost if a non-BAM client is used or the contract is broken.",

Over 95% of stake flows through this system, reshaping how value moves on Solana.\n* **Not all MEV is harmful**. Bundles enable value-creating strategies like protected arbitrage and cross-protocol coordination.\n* Developers must design**MEV-aware transactions.**Use bundles, simulate fees, and route sensitive flows through private relays.\nSince day one, Solana has focused on delivering unmatched speed and throughput, making it a go-to choice for high-performance blockchain applications. This approach has fueled massive on-chain activity, drawing in developers, retail users, and institutions alike. Its emphasis on performance continues to shape a vibrant and growing ecosystem.\nBut as transaction volume surged, a second "

But did you know that DeFi users and dApp developers can also benefit from Jito’s MEV infrastructure to boost the reliability, efficiency, and security of their Solana transactions?\nIn this article, we’ll explore the capabilities and benefits of the Jito MEV Client and guide you in integrating it into your Solana development workflow.\n## What is Jito on Solana? Key takeaways\n**Jito**is building a more efficient infrastructure to optimize MEV on**Solana**and enable faster, more predictable transaction execution. It integrates mechanisms that ensure MEV is distributed to stakers as well.\n* The core piece of Jito infrastructure is a Solana validator client that is also MEV optimized. The mechanisms like bundling, block engine auctions, and relayer are part of the client’s software.\n* Bundles are a feature unique to the Jito-Solana validator. Bundled transactions get guaranteed ordering and atomic execution.\n* Jito use"

This page will be updated periodically with new developments. Read our latest[Solana MEV Report](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-mev-report)(Jan 2025).\n## [Takeaways](#takeaways)\nThis post aims to provide a baseline understanding of how MEV on Solana works. In short:\n* MEV on Solana is not dead.\n* Not all MEV is bad.\n* Profitable frontrunning is possible across DEX liquidity venues structures, not just AMMs.\n* Solana’s continuous block production and lack of an in-protocol mempool changes the default behavior and social dynamics of the chain.\n* Someone else may fork or try to otherwise replicate Jito’s out-of-protocol mempool to extract more MEV, but it is hard both technically and socially.\n* Many validators support the decision to remove the Jito mempool, foregoing sandwiching revenue, in favor of the long-term growth and health of Solana.## [Introduction](#introduction)\nIn a[Proof-of-Stake network](https://www.helius.dev/blog/proof-of-history-proof-of-stake-proof-of-work-explained#what’s-proof-of-stake), when you are assigned leader of a given block, you have the authority to determine the contents of your assigned block. Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to any value derived from adding, removing, or reordering the transactions within a given block.\nAs activity and general interest have been increasing on Solana, MEV is becoming an[increasingly discussed topic](https://x.com/aajxbt/status/1765512478316793865?s=20). On January 10, 2024, a searcher tipped a validator 890 SOL, one of the largest tips in Jito’"

It operates core components that improve ordering, latency, and rewards. Its stack includes the Jito-Solana validator client, the Block Engine and bundles, ShredStream, relayers, and a liquid staking program. You use these tools to route order flow, protect users, and capture lawful MEV. You also use them to observe blocks faster and coordinate complex transactions.\nThe platform does not sell retail “trading bots.” It ships infrastructure, clients, and APIs that others integrate. The audience includes validators, searchers, builders, dApps, wallets, and institutional treasuries. Each group plugs into different surfaces and policies. Each group also assumes different operational risks.\n## Audience Paths\n1\n### Validators\nRun the Jito-Solana client and connect a relayer. Configure MEV tip collection and payment programs. Monitor leader schedules and slot health. Review runbooks for co-hosted or separate relayer deployments. Track MEV rewards and validator performance across epochs.\n2\n### Searchers and HFT firms\nBuild bundles for auction. Use gRPC or JSON-RPC for fast sending. Test revert protection and atomic execution. Simulate routes and fees before bidding. Align with Block Engine policy and rate limits.\n3\n### dApps, wallets, and bot platforms\nUse private routing to avoid harmful orderflow leakage. Use low-latency send to land time-sensitive transactions. Use bundles for multi-tx atomicity. Provide users with MEV protection paths as defaults.\n4\n### Stakers and Treasuries\nStake SOL to the Jito stake pool and receive JitoSOL. Earn staking rewards plus MEV-driven yield. Review program docs and risk notes before onboarding capital. Track TVL, APY, and integrations in the staking hub.\n## "

executed, and monetized, especially at scale.\\n* Two markets compete for blockspace:**priority fees and bundle auctions.**Standard transactions use tips; high-value flows use Jito bundles for atomic execution.\\n* **Jito controls the MEV stack:**validator software, relay infrastructure, and staking. Over 95% of stake flows through this system, reshaping how value moves on Solana.\\n* **Not all MEV is harmful**. Bundles enable value-creating strategies like protected arbitrage and cross-protocol coordination.\\n* Developers must design**MEV-aware transactions.**Use bundles, simulate fees, and route sensitive flows through private relays.\\nSince day one, Solana has focused on delivering unmatched speed and throughput, making it a go-to choice for high-performance blockchain applications. This approach has fueled massive on-chain activity, drawing in developers, retail users, and institutions alike. Its emphasis on performance continues to shape a vibrant and growing ecosystem.\\nBut as transaction volume surged, a second \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"How Jito Works - A Deep Dive\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.eclipse.xyz/articles/how-jito-works--on-solana-deep-dive\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"text\": \"How Jito Works - A Deep Dive\\nCookie and Terms of Service Consent:\\nBy using this site, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

But did you know that DeFi users and dApp developers can also benefit from Jito’s MEV infrastructure to boost the reliability, efficiency, and security of their Solana transactions?\\nIn this article, we’ll explore the capabilities and benefits of the Jito MEV Client and guide you in integrating it into your Solana development workflow.\\n## What is Jito on Solana? Key takeaways\\n**Jito**is building a more efficient infrastructure to optimize MEV on**Solana**and enable faster, more predictable transaction execution. It integrates mechanisms that ensure MEV is distributed to stakers as well.\\n* The core piece of Jito infrastructure is a Solana validator client that is also MEV optimized. The mechanisms like bundling, block engine auctions, and relayer are part of the client’s software.\\n* Bundles are a feature unique to the Jito-Solana validator.

This page will be updated periodically with new developments. Read our latest[Solana MEV Report](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-mev-report)(Jan 2025).\\n## [Takeaways](#takeaways)\\nThis post aims to provide a baseline understanding of how MEV on Solana works. In short:\\n* MEV on Solana is not dead.\\n* Not all MEV is bad.\\n* Profitable frontrunning is possible across DEX liquidity venues structures, not just AMMs.\\n* Solana’s continuous block production and lack of an in-protocol mempool changes the default behavior and social dynamics of the chain.\\n* Someone else may fork or try to otherwise replicate Jito’s out-of-protocol mempool to extract more MEV, but it is hard both technically and socially.\\n* Many validators support the decision to remove the Jito mempool, foregoing sandwiching revenue, in favor of the long-term growth and health of Solana.## [Introduction](#introduction)\\nIn a[Proof-of-Stake network](https://www.helius.dev/blog/proof-of-history-proof-of-stake-proof-of-work-explained#what’s-proof-of-stake), when you are assigned leader of a given block, you have the authority to determine the contents of your assigned block. Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to any value derived from adding, removing, or reordering the transactions within a given block.\\nAs activity and general interest have been increasing on Solana, MEV is becoming an[increasingly discussed topic](https://x.com/aajxbt/status/1765512478316793865?s=20).

for Innovators\\n![Jito Labs](https://blockchain.oodles.io/wp-content/themes/blockchain-child/assets/images/sc/jito-labs.png)\\n## What Jito Labs Is (and Is Not)\\nIt builds MEV and block-building infrastructure for Solana. It operates core components that improve ordering, latency, and rewards. Its stack includes the Jito-Solana validator client, the Block Engine and bundles, ShredStream, relayers, and a liquid staking program. You use these tools to route order flow, protect users, and capture lawful MEV. You also use them to observe blocks faster and coordinate complex transactions.\\nThe platform does not sell retail “trading bots.” It ships infrastructure, clients, and APIs that others integrate. The audience includes validators, searchers, builders, dApps, wallets, and institutional treasuries. Each group plugs into different surfaces and policies. Each group also assumes different operational risks.\\n## Audience Paths\\n1\\n### Validators\\nRun the Jito-Solana client and connect a relayer. Configure MEV tip collection and payment programs. Monitor leader schedules and slot health. Review runbooks for co-hosted or separate relayer deployments. Track MEV rewards and validator performance across epochs.\\n2\\n### Searchers and HFT firms\\nBuild bundles for auction. Use gRPC or JSON-RPC for fast sending. Test revert protection and atomic execution. Simulate routes and fees before bidding. Align with Block Engine policy and rate limits.\\n3\\n### dApps, wallets, and bot platforms\\nUse private routing to avoid harmful orderflow leakage. Use low-latency send to land time-sensitive transactions. Use bundles for multi-tx atomicity. Provide users with MEV protection paths as defaults.\\n4\\n### Stakers and Treasuries\\nStake SOL to the Jito stake pool and receive JitoSOL. Earn staking rewards plus MEV-driven yield. Review program docs and risk notes before onboarding capital. Track TVL, APY, and integrations in the staking hub.\\n## \"\n  }\n]\n\nExecution Time: 1406.13ms\nSearch Parameters: {\n  \"query\": \"how does Jito's MEV distribution mechanism work\",\n  \"numResults\": 15,\n  \"includeText\": true,\n  \"maxCharacters\": 2000\n}"

Execution is described as a pure Rust environment without VM restrictions, built with a sovereign SDK. Settlement involves ZK proving of execution data posted to Celestia via Succinct SP1, with verification on Solana L1. Consensus relies on Solana L1 validators and consensus as the underlying trust assumption. Data Availability is achieved by posting all execution data from the Bullet rollup to Celestia, ensuring cheap and efficient data availability.

The successful model emerged with a relatively small team, becoming one of the top venues for trading, price predictions and high-profile whale moves.

DEX market is maturing with DEXs capturing 20% of crypto trading volume and perpetual futures accounting for 65% of DEX activity.\n2. With a 76.7% market share and over $1.5 trillion in total volume, Hyperliquid is the undisputed leader in onchain perpetual futures.\n3. HyperBFT (consensus), HyperCore (execution), and HyperEVM (smart contracts) operate in a unified state —enabling performance, liquidity, and composability on a single chain.\n4. 97% of protocol revenue goes into buying back $HYPE. With no VC allocations, the model prioritizes community ownership and long-term deflation.\n5. HyperUnit allows native BTC, ETH, and SOL deposits without custodial wrappers or synthetic assets, enabling true collateral mobility and regulatory-aware design.\n### *What if a decentralized exchange could match the performance of a centralized one and then go even further?*\nHyperliquid is doing just that.

It has grown to regularly rank in the top 3 perp DEXs by volume thanks to its smooth UX, easy onboarding via its Arbitrum bridge, and wide range of popular tokens listed (over 100 at the time of writing).\n- Key features include hyperps which are essentially perp contracts for unlisted tokens e.g. ZRO (LayerZero). In addition, the community can deposit USDC into vaults where they can benefit from market making and liquidation strategies on the platform.\n- A points program is running until April, where 1m points are distributed each week. Participating in the protocol's various features earns users points.\n- The project remains in its infancy and is expected to decentralize its validator set later this year. It will be interesting to observe what effect, if any, this has on performance. In addition, a new consensus algorithm is being developed with the intention of bringing the protocol on par with CEXs. Whether or not the protocol can achieve these aims will be key in determining its future success.\n\n## Introduction\n\nHyperliquid is an L1 perp DEX (with an Arbitrum bridge) that is capable of 20k orders per second with a fully on-chain order book. It seeks to directly compete with CEXs in terms of user experience and cost and has become a notable player in the DEX space. It offers a very wide range of assets for leverage trading (101 as of 5 Jan 2024), combined with a CEX-like UX that makes it very attractive to degens.\n\nIt opened up a points program in November 2023 stated to last for 6 months (until April 2024). This has notably increased usage across all metrics on the exchange, and volumes have ranged from $190m - to almost $1b each day since 4 December 2023. Many expect an airdrop to be tied to this points program.\n\nHyperliq"

From a few billion dollars in early 2024,  daily trading volumes on perp DEXs have exceeded  $100 billion by the first week of October 2025.\\nFor much of this explosive evolution over the last 12 months,**Hyperliquid**was the undisputed leader, commanding around 70% of market share. But by October 2025, its dominance had declined as**Aster**and**Lighter**entered the scene. Today, the perpetual derivatives market is a three-way race, with each platform offering distinct technical and product innovations that reshape how traders interact with decentralized finance.\\n![Decentralized perpetual exchanges marketshare](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68b01c26946cffef7d668652/68e55e81f4c6834e09ce7f97_68e375a4ff09527f01806325_631c4b5e.png)\\n## **Market Shifts: From Dominance to Competition**\\nPerp DEXs have started in September 2025 with a major shift in dynamics.

In September 2025, trading volumes on Perp DEXs surpassed $1 trillion, accounting for over 20% of centralized exchange (CEX) perpetual futures volume—a dramatic increase from less than 2% in 2022. This surge underscores the growing demand for decentralized, transparent, and efficient trading platforms.\\n\\nAmong the top players in this space, **Hyperliquid** has emerged as a leader, leveraging cutting-edge technology and innovative features to redefine the trading experience.

DEX market is maturing with DEXs capturing 20% of crypto trading volume and perpetual futures accounting for 65% of DEX activity.\\n2. With a 76.7% market share and over $1.5 trillion in total volume, Hyperliquid is the undisputed leader in onchain perpetual futures.\\n3. HyperBFT (consensus), HyperCore (execution), and HyperEVM (smart contracts) operate in a unified state —enabling performance, liquidity, and composability on a single chain.\\n4. 97% of protocol revenue goes into buying back $HYPE. With no VC allocations, the model prioritizes community ownership and long-term deflation.\\n5. HyperUnit allows native BTC, ETH, and SOL deposits without custodial wrappers or synthetic assets, enabling true collateral mobility and regulatory-aware design.\\n### *What if a decentralized exchange could match the performance of a centralized one and then go even further?*\\nHyperliquid is doing just that.

It has grown to regularly rank in the top 3 perp DEXs by volume thanks to its smooth UX, easy onboarding via its Arbitrum bridge, and wide range of popular tokens listed (over 100 at the time of writing).\\n- Key features include hyperps which are essentially perp contracts for unlisted tokens e.g. ZRO (LayerZero). In addition, the community can deposit USDC into vaults where they can benefit from market making and liquidation strategies on the platform.\\n- A points program is running until April, where 1m points are distributed each week. Participating in the protocol's various features earns users points.\\n- The project remains in its infancy and is expected to decentralize its validator set later this year. It will be interesting to observe what effect, if any, this has on performance. In addition, a new consensus algorithm is being developed with the intention of bringing the protocol on par with CEXs. Whether or not the protocol can achieve these aims will be key in determining its future success.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nHyperliquid is an L1 perp DEX (with an Arbitrum bridge) that is capable of 20k orders per second with a fully on-chain order book. It seeks to directly compete with CEXs in terms of user experience and cost and has become a notable player in the DEX space. It offers a very wide range of assets for leverage trading (101 as of 5 Jan 2024), combined with a CEX-like UX that makes it very attractive to degens.\\n\\nIt opened up a points program in November 2023 stated to last for 6 months (until April 2024). This has notably increased usage across all metrics on the exchange, and volumes have ranged from $190m - to almost $1b each day since 4 December 2023. Many expect an airdrop to be tied to this points program.\\n\\nHyperliq\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Hyperliquid claims 80% of DeFi perp market, challenging centralized giants with decentralized edge\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.theblock.co/post/355863/hyperliquid-claims-80-of-defi-perp-market-challenging-centralized-giants-with-decentralized-edge\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-06-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"By Brandon Kae and Ivan Wu\",\n    \"text\": \"[Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy.

The image highlights that users transfer and request backing assets in exchange for/from USDe. Ethena needs to safely and securely custody protocol backing assets, transfer assets between smart contracts and users, and delegate/undelegate assets between \"Off-Exchange Settlement\" providers and centralized exchanges. The image also provides examples of internal workflows, such as when a user successfully mints USDe, the asset is transferred to the Minting smart contract, and then directly to the \"Off-Exchange Settlement\" provider.

Its governance token, ENA, coordinates protocol parameters, incentives, and community decision-making. Ethena’s approach sits at the intersection of stablecoins, derivatives markets, and Ethereum staking, making it one of the most discussed crypto projects since its launch.\n\nThis article explains how USDe works, where its yield comes from, what ENA is for, major risks and considerations, and how users can interact with the ecosystem in 2025.\n\n## The Big Idea: A Delta-Neutral Synthetic Dollar\n\nTraditional stablecoins are backed by fiat reserves. Ethena’s USDe is different: it achieves dollar stability via a delta-neutral strategy. In short, USDe is collateralized by crypto assets (primarily staked ETH), while the protocol takes offsetting short positions in perpetual futures to hedge price risk. The goal is to maintain a stable dollar exposure while accruing yield from two sources:\n\n- Staking rewards from ETH (via liquid staking derivatives such as stETH)\n- Funding payments from perpetual futures (the “basis” trade)\n\nFor a deeper look at USDe’s mechanism and risk framework, see Ethena’s documentation and transparency resources via the official docs and blog:\n\n- Ethena Docs: [docs.ethena.fi](https://docs.ethena.fi/)\n- Protocol Mechanics Overview: [USDe and sUSDe in the docs](https://docs.eth"

Its governance token, ENA, coordinates protocol parameters, incentives, and community decision-making. Ethena’s approach sits at the intersection of stablecoins, derivatives markets, and Ethereum staking, making it one of the most discussed crypto projects since its launch.\\n\\nThis article explains how USDe works, where its yield comes from, what ENA is for, major risks and considerations, and how users can interact with the ecosystem in 2025.\\n\\n## The Big Idea: A Delta-Neutral Synthetic Dollar\\n\\nTraditional stablecoins are backed by fiat reserves. Ethena’s USDe is different: it achieves dollar stability via a delta-neutral strategy. In short, USDe is collateralized by crypto assets (primarily staked ETH), while the protocol takes offsetting short positions in perpetual futures to hedge price risk. The goal is to maintain a stable dollar exposure while accruing yield from two sources:\\n\\n- Staking rewards from ETH (via liquid staking derivatives such as stETH)\\n- Funding payments from perpetual futures (the “basis” trade)\\n\\nFor a deeper look at USDe’s mechanism and risk framework, see Ethena’s documentation and transparency resources via the official docs and blog:\\n\\n- Ethena Docs: [docs.ethena.fi](https://docs.ethena.fi/)\\n- Protocol Mechanics Overview: [USDe and sUSDe in the docs](https://docs.eth\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Ethena (ENA): A Deep Dive into the Ecosystem\",\n    \"url\": \"https://oakresearch.io/en/analyses/fundamentals/ethena-ena-deep-dive-into-ecosystem\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-09-04T13:43:54.000Z\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"text\": \"Ethena (ENA): A Deep Dive into the Ecosystem | OAK Research\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"What is ethena (ENA)?

The 'true' and 'obvious' quadrant states that crypto isn't viewed as a scam anymore, Alt-L1 narratives are shaky, AI, not crypto, is the main trade, blockchain revenue is cyclical casino flow, not recurring income, and infra is priced as if 100x usage is guaranteed. The 'false' and 'obvious' quadrant states that ETH and SOL are cheap once you include staking yields, LIs deserve SaaS-style valuations, high fees = real, stable revenue, infra investment alone brings users, and token multiples are justified today. The 'true' and 'non-obvious' quadrant states that markets stop believing narratives when fundamentals lag, staking rewards are dilution, not value capture, L2s drain most of ETH's value capture, blockspace is a commodity; user aggregators win, and real upside comes from plugging crypto rails into existing businesses. The 'false' and 'non-obvious' quadrant states that adoption = number go up, corporates will adopt public chains out of ideology, today's LI winners will dominate the next decade, token prices validate tech success, and users care about TPS more than convenience.",

The chart shows negligible activity until mid-2021, followed by steady growth through 2023, and an exponential surge starting in early 2024. By January 2026, the total value reaches approximately $20 billion.

The text predicts that by 2026, payments following the x402 standard will account for 30% of daily transactions on the Base network and 5% of non-vote transactions on the Solana network. This shift signals an increasing use of onchain rails for agentic interactions. The report identifies three primary drivers for this growth: improvements in AI agent intelligence, continued adoption of stablecoins, and enhanced developer tooling, which collectively will allow x402 and other agentic payment standards to capture a larger share of onchain activity.",

Its strategic partnership with Coinbase enables the tokenization of a diverse range of assets, attracting incremental liquidity, while evidence suggests Ethereum TVL is more likely to migrate to Base than Solana.

Solana, a high-performance blockchain ecosystem, has played a pivotal role in the growth of memecoins, contributing significantly to its decentralized app (dApp) revenue and overall ecosystem expansion. However, the rise of Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer-2 network, has introduced new competition, sparking debates about ecosystem dominance and innovation.\n\n## Base vs. Solana: Competing for Memecoin Ecosystem Dominance\n\nThe rivalry between Solana and Base has intensified as both ecosystems compete for memecoin dominance. Solana remains a leading blockchain ecosystem, generating $1.6 billion in dApp revenue during the first half of 2025, with memecoins accounting for 62% of this revenue. Meanwhile, Base has rapidly gained traction, capturing 16.8% of investor interest in 2024 and introducing innovative concepts like contentcoins.\n\n### Zora's Role in Token Creation and User Growth\n\nA key driver of Base's growth is Zora, which accounted for 44.6% of token creation activity on the network. With over 2 million monthly active users and significant growth in new user adoption, Zora has become a cornerstone of Base's ecosystem. This surge in activity underscores the growing appeal of Base as a platform for launching memecoins and other tokenized assets.\n\n## Economic Impact of Memecoins on Solana's Ecosystem\n\nDespite criticism from Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who referred to memecoins and NFTs as \"digital slop,\" these assets have significantly contributed to Solana's revenue. Memecoins alone generated $1.6 billion in the first half of 2025, highlighting their economic importance. This duality—criticism from leade"

However, Solana's dominance faces challenges amid emerging ecosystems like Sui and BNB Chain.\n\nIn 2025, the Solana ecosystem emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, capturing 26.79% of global interest in chain-specific crypto narratives, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-popular-blockchain-ecosystems). Despite maintaining the top spot, Solana's dominance decreased by 12 percentage points from the previous year, indicating challenges in expanding beyond its association with meme coin speculation and price stagnation.\n\n## Base and Ethereum Ecosystems\n\nFollowing Solana, the Base ecosystem, associated with crypto exchange Coinbase, held 13.94% of global investor interest. It experienced a smaller decline in mindshare compared to last year, despite developments like the rebranding of Coinbase Wallet and partnerships for USDC payments. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ecosystem retained its third-place position, growing its mindshare by 2.7 percentage points to 13.43%, narrowing the gap with Base.\n\n## Emerging Ecosystems: Sui and BNB Chain\n\nThe Sui and BNB Chain ecosystems saw significant growth, moving up to fourth and fifth positions respectively. Sui achieved the largest mindshare growth, reaching 11.77%, positioning itself as a strong contender in blockchain narratives. BNB Chain's interest surged to 9.05%, bolstered by the launch of Binance Alpha and resilient BNB price action.\n\n## New Entrants and Shifting Dynamics\n\nNew entrants like the XRP Ledger and Bittensor ecosystems have made notable entries into the top rankings, with XRP Ledger capturing 4.68% mindshare. Hyperliquid, another newcomer, increased its mindshare significantly, marking its presence with the USDH l"

One such milestone is the integration of the PUMP token on the Solana and Base networks. This strategic move is set to enhance liquidity, trading opportunities, and adoption of the token, while showcasing the unique strengths of these blockchain platforms. In this article, we’ll delve into the implications of this integration, the technical advantages of Solana and Base networks, and the broader impact on the crypto ecosystem.\n\n## Solana’s High-Speed, Low-Cost Transaction Capabilities\n\nSolana has established itself as a leading blockchain platform, celebrated for its high-speed and low-cost transaction capabilities. By leveraging its innovative **Proof of History (PoH)** consensus mechanism, Solana processes thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and memecoins. This efficiency not only reduces transaction fees but also ensures scalability, which is critical for supporting high trading volumes.\n\n### Proof of History: A Game-Changer for Blockchain Performance\n\nThe Proof of History consensus mechanism is a revolutionary innovation that sets Solana apart from other blockchains. By creating cryptographic timestamps for transactions, PoH enables faster validation and sequencing. This approach minimizes bottlenecks and ensures Solana remains a high-performance platform, even during peak activity periods.\n\n## Token Unlock Events: Market Implications and Dynamics\n\nToken unlock events are pivotal moments in the crypto market, often influencing supply and demand dynamics. Solana’s upcoming release of 11.2 million SOL tokens, representing 2.3% of its circulating supply, is one such event. "

Certain services and features may not be available in your jurisdiction.\n\n## Introduction: Solana's Position in the Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nSolana has established itself as a high-performance blockchain, renowned for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. However, the blockchain industry is evolving rapidly, with competitors emerging to challenge Solana's position. From Ethereum alternatives to innovative layer-1 blockchains like Sui, Aptos, Avalanche, and Base, the competition is intensifying. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Solana's biggest competitors, focusing on technical capabilities, ecosystem growth, and innovations shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\n## Solana vs Ethereum: Speed, Scalability, and Cost Efficiency\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, is often compared to Solana due to its widespread adoption and robust ecosystem. While Ethereum dominates in terms of network effects and developer activity, Solana differentiates itself with its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike.\n\n### Key Metrics Comparison\n\n- **Transaction Speed (TPS):** Solana boasts a theoretical TPS of 65,000, significantly outperforming Ethereum's current capacity of around 30 TPS. Although Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, aim to improve scalability, they still fall short of Solana's native performance.\n\n- **Transaction Costs:** Solana's fees are consistently lower, often measured in fractions of a cent, compared to Ethereum's higher gas fees, which fluctuate based on network congestion.\n\n\n### Ecosystem Growth\n\nEthereum remains the leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Solana has made significant strides in gaming and decentralized applications (dApps). Despite these advancements, Ethereum's established network effects and developer community continue to pose challenges for "

Certain services and features may not be available in your jurisdiction.\\n\\n## Introduction: Solana's Position in the Blockchain Ecosystem\\n\\nSolana has established itself as a high-performance blockchain, renowned for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. However, the blockchain industry is evolving rapidly, with competitors emerging to challenge Solana's position. From Ethereum alternatives to innovative layer-1 blockchains like Sui, Aptos, Avalanche, and Base, the competition is intensifying. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Solana's biggest competitors, focusing on technical capabilities, ecosystem growth, and innovations shaping the future of blockchain technology.\\n\\n## Solana vs Ethereum: Speed, Scalability, and Cost Efficiency\\n\\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, is often compared to Solana due to its widespread adoption and robust ecosystem. While Ethereum dominates in terms of network effects and developer activity, Solana differentiates itself with its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike.\\n\\n### Key Metrics Comparison\\n\\n- **Transaction Speed (TPS):** Solana boasts a theoretical TPS of 65,000, significantly outperforming Ethereum's current capacity of around 30 TPS. Although Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, aim to improve scalability, they still fall short of Solana's native performance.\\n\\n- **Transaction Costs:** Solana's fees are consistently lower, often measured in fractions of a cent, compared to Ethereum's higher gas fees, which fluctuate based on network congestion.\\n\\n\\n### Ecosystem Growth\\n\\nEthereum remains the leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Solana has made significant strides in gaming and decentralized applications (dApps). Despite these advancements, Ethereum's established network effects and developer community continue to pose challenges for \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Solana Ecosystem Report (H1 2025)\",\n    \"url\": \"https://helius.dev/blog/solana-ecosystem-report-h1-2025\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-07-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"0xIchigo\",\n    \"text\": \"Solana Ecosystem Report (H1 2025) —Earnings &amp; Growth\\n![Solana Ecosystem Report (H1 2025)](https://helius.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2FH1-Banner.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90)\\nBlog/Research\\n# Solana Ecosystem Report (H1 2025)\\n![0xIchigo](https://helius.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2Fichi-bro.jpg&amp;w=96&amp;q=90)\\n0xIchigo\\n116min read\\nJuly 1, 2025\\n### Table of Contents\\nMany thanks to[Lostin](https://x.com/__lostin__),[Brady](https://x.com/bradyowen_),[Mert](https://x.com/0xMert_), and[Jacob Creech](https://x.com/jacobvcreech)for reading earlier drafts of this report, and to[Tzvi Wiesel](https://x.com/web4O),[Uncle G](https://x.com/photons_enjoyor), and[kdot](https://x.com/kdotcrypto)for their insights and feedback on their respective case studies.\\n## [Actionable Insights](#actionable-insights)\\n**Network Performance**\\n* Solana has achieved over 15 months of continuous uptime since February 2024—its longest streak since launch.\\n* Solana consistently processes over 162 million transactions daily with median fees well under a penny, even during peak demand periods like the TRUMP-mania of January 2025.\\n* Solana is sufficiently decentralized regarding its validator set, the ASN and geographic distribution of its stake, and the multitude of different developers working on its clients—no single entity, developer, hosting provider, or country controls a majority of stake and could halt the network.\\n* Slot times consistently average around 390 ms following Agave’s 2.1 release, while the networking stack’s memory usage has been reduced from 2.6 GB to 124 MB.\\n* Solana executes more successful transactions daily than all other blockchains combined.\\n**Economic Dominance**\\n* Since October 2024, Solana has consistently outperformed every other blockchain in Real Economic Value (REV), generating over $550 million USD in January 2025 alone.\\n* Solana commanded 81% of all DEX transactions across crypto in 2024, with over $890 billion USD in DEX trading volume f\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Solana Future: Architecting Innovation and Institutional ...\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.tradingkey.com/analysis/cryptocurrencies/sol/261464790-solana-sol-company-whitepaper-updates-grayscale-trust-dropping-future-prediction-tradingkey\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2026-01-11T22:17:25.019Z\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"text\": \"Solana Future: Architecting Innovation and Institutional Confidence for the Next SOL Cycle\\n[![tradingkey.logo](https://resource.tradingkey.com/cdn/images/logo/web-logo-light.png)](https://www.tradingkey.com/)\\n[\\nMarkets\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/markets)\\n[\\nNews\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/news)\\n[\\nAnalysis\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/analysis)\\n[\\nTools\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/tools)\\n[\\nLearn\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/learn)\\n[\\nStockScore\\n![Stock Score](https://resource.tradingkey.com/cdn/images/tools/icon-score.png)\\n](https://www.tradingkey.com/tools/stock-score)\\n&#xe66c;\\n**\\nScan to Download\\nOne powerful score.

It then explains that Tempo is a platform like SWIFT or ACH. The text then explores why businesses might find crypto easier, faster, or better. Several reasons are provided: instant on-chain transfers avoiding trapped liquidity, lower fees than cards, reliability, fewer currency conversions, and access to USD-based functionality. The text also touches on regulatory aspects, mentioning that stablecoins are now formally regulated in the US and Europe. It suggests that the primary reason for seeking alternatives to traditional methods is not necessarily illegitimate activity, but rather a lack of understanding of the challenges and costs associated with high-volume cross-border money movement. The US government is mentioned as a large customer of Bridge, which is somewhat ironic."

For example, a [CryptoPunk NFT](https://nftnow.com/features/most-expensive-nft-sales/) was purchased for 8,000 ETH ($23.7 million) in February 2022, and the most famous example is [_Everydays: The First 5000 Days_](https://opensea.io/assets/0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756/40913) for $69.3 million, produced by Mike Winkelmann (a.k.a. Beeple).\n\nIt is nonsensical to spend an enormous amount of money on a CryptoPunk NFT; perhaps I’m missing something that could justify forking out ( _tens of_) millions of dollars.\n\nI’d make an exception to Beeple’s record-breaking collectible, as unlike the former, it’s a montage of 5000 pieces of artwork involving vast creativity. Even then, I’d prefer dozens of prestigious homes, but I digress.\n\nSo why do I believe they’ll experience a renaissance this cycle? A major advantage of this bull market is the availability of various alternatives to Ethereum for minting and trading NFTs.\n\nThe rising popularity of S"

Like stablecoins, TMMFs circulate on public permissionless \nblockchains but offer returns at money market rates and regulatory protections as securities.\n• TMMFs currently cater strongly to decentralised finance protocols and rely on “allow-listing” of \nblockchain wallets to constrain peer-to-peer trading of their tokens to ensure regulatory \ncompliance. However, such allow lists only constrain direct holding of TMMFs.\n• TMMFs give rise to risks that mirror, and potentia"

This is a real, deep dive into the five crypto sectors I believe will dominate the space in the coming years. I’m sharing my research to help you navigate the often overwhelming world of crypto. Before we begin, a big thank you to all the new followers — I hope this content lives up to your expectations and truly adds value. Here’s the roadmap for this piece: we’ll start by breaking down Bitcoin dominance and how it ties to the upcoming altseason. Then, we’ll explore how institutions have reshaped this cycle’s dynamics. After that, we’ll dive into each of the five critical sectors, examining why they matter. Finally, we’ll discuss potential risks and positioning strategies to consider. Let’s dive in!

Bitcoin ETFs recorded $2.3 billion in net inflows during the week of September 8–12, 2025 — the largest weekly tally in three months ( TradingNews, September 15, 2025). Yet this institutional money isn’t flowing randomly into every altcoin. It’s concentrating in specific sectors that solve real-world problems.

Several reasons are provided: instant on-chain transfers avoiding trapped liquidity, lower fees than cards, reliability, fewer currency conversions, and access to USD-based functionality. The text also touches on regulatory aspects, mentioning that stablecoins are now formally regulated in the US and Europe.

For example, a [CryptoPunk NFT](https://nftnow.com/features/most-expensive-nft-sales/) was purchased for 8,000 ETH ($23.7 million) in February 2022, and the most famous example is [_Everydays: The First 5000 Days_](https://opensea.io/assets/0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756/40913) for $69.3 million, produced by Mike Winkelmann (a.k.a. Beeple).\\n\\nIt is nonsensical to spend an enormous amount of money on a CryptoPunk NFT; perhaps I’m missing something that could justify forking out ( _tens of_) millions of dollars.\\n\\nI’d make an exception to Beeple’s record-breaking collectible, as unlike the former, it’s a montage of 5000 pieces of artwork involving vast creativity. Even then, I’d prefer dozens of prestigious homes, but I digress.\\n\\nSo why do I believe they’ll experience a renaissance this cycle?

Here’s the roadmap for this piece: we’ll start by breaking down Bitcoin dominance and how it ties to the upcoming altseason. Then, we’ll explore how institutions have reshaped this cycle’s dynamics. After that, we’ll dive into each of the five critical sectors, examining why they matter. Finally, we’ll discuss potential risks and positioning strategies to consider. Let’s dive in!

The post discusses a mental model for front-running the next big crypto wave. It suggests focusing on identifying narratives early, mapping capital rotation, exiting at peak expectations, and banking profits. The post then asks if another narrative wave is coming and lists factors for narrative recycling: technical innovation, fresh catalysts, and a committed community. The image also includes a tweet from Ignas about speculation on narratives in waves. The post is dated June 5, 2025.",

The author believes Open Finance is poised to &quot;cross the chasm&quot; into mainstream adoption in 2026, driven by its native development speed.\n* **DeFi 2.0 &amp; New Narratives**: The next phase, termed DeFi 2.0, will focus on pragmatic areas like On-chain Asset Management, RWA (Real World Assets) finance, and tokenization. However, the current RWA narrative is seen as immature and demand-driven rather than systematically built.\n* **Geopolitical Shift**: A key driver will be explosive adoption in emerging developing economies (e.g., Nigeria, India, Brazil), where crypto finance use is growing exponentially, contrasting with the regulatory struggles of developed nations and reshaping global economic dynamics.\n* **New Frameworks**: Concepts like DAT 2.0 (Digital Asset Token) and Tokenomics 2.0 represent the evolution towards sustainable integration of crypto value with traditional finance, moving beyond the speculative models of the past.\n* **2026 Outlook**: The year is predicted to be a crucial inflection point characterized by further macroeconomic disorder and restructuring, which will paradoxically fuel the explosion and maturation of De"

It is capable of causing massive price spikes or drowning a promising DeFi project despite its utility and the passion of its development team. We will discuss top crypto narratives in 2025 and think about the potential impact of these stories on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nLet’s start with a simple question: [what are crypto narratives](https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/what-are-narratives-in-crypto)? How can a simple story move gigantic market caps and decisively affect market sentiment?\n\n## What are narratives in crypto?\n\nImagine yourself as a confused little boy preparing to go into a fight with a bully. You are afraid, you don’t believe in yourself… You want to run. Then, an older brother says that the guy in front of you is not that strong and you can easily win. Others start encouraging you saying that courage beats strength and the victory is one hit away.\n\nWell, this story has two possible scenarios:\n\n1. A little boy believes in himself, rushes into the fight, and wins thanks to the encouragement of others. The story ends well and the impact of the rapidly forming narrative makes it possible for you to find the necessary resources to win.\n2. A little boy believes in himself, rushes into the fight, and receives a beating like never before in his life. This ending is the result of a story full of lies that inspired someone to act on false promises and unfounded hype.\n\nThe same is true for top narratives in crypto. A story can stand on a solid fo"

As we look ahead to 2025, DeFi trends in 2025 are poised to redefine the landscape of blockchain-based finance. [According to CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-narratives), The DeFi development in 2025 will focus on the growing intersection between traditional finance and blockchain innovation, with a range of new technologies, from AI-powered agents to liquid staking and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), driving these shifts.\n\nAccording to recent insights from [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/02/26/crypto-for-advisors-defi-and-on-chain-finance), DeFi and on-chain finance are becoming more integral to the broader crypto ecosystem, driving significant shifts in how financial transactions are conducted .With market dynamics evolving rapidly, it's essential to understand the DeFi narratives in 2025 that are likely to dominate the conversation. Whether it's the explosive growth of stablecoins, the increasing importance of liquid staking and restaking on Bitcoin, or the rise of DeFi projects types in 2025 targeting real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, these trends promise to bring both challenges and opportunities to DeFi enthusiasts and investors alike.\n\nAs the DeFi landscape in 2025 continues to mature, these trends provide valuable insight into the future of decentralized finance, shaping how DeFi will impact everything from liquidity pools to asset tokenization. This article explores the key narratives that are set to define the DeFi space in 2025, offering a glimpse into what found"

A range of DeFi protocols implements\nthese services as a suite of smart contracts, ie software programs that encode the logic of\nconventional financial operations. Instead of transacting with a counterparty, DeFi users\nthus interact with software programs that pool the resources of other DeFi users to maintain\ncontrol over their funds. This paper provides a deep dive into the overall architecture, the\ntechnical primitives, and the financial functionalities of DeFi protocols. We analyse and\nexplain the individual components and how they interact"

As we look ahead to 2025, DeFi trends in 2025 are poised to redefine the landscape of blockchain-based finance. [According to CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-narratives), The DeFi development in 2025 will focus on the growing intersection between traditional finance and blockchain innovation, with a range of new technologies, from AI-powered agents to liquid staking and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), driving these shifts.\\n\\nAccording to recent insights from [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/02/26/crypto-for-advisors-defi-and-on-chain-finance), DeFi and on-chain finance are becoming more integral to the broader crypto ecosystem, driving significant shifts in how financial transactions are conducted .With market dynamics evolving rapidly, it's essential to understand the DeFi narratives in 2025 that are likely to dominate the conversation. Whether it's the explosive growth of stablecoins, the increasing importance of liquid staking and restaking on Bitcoin, or the rise of DeFi projects types in 2025 targeting real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, these trends promise to bring both challenges and opportunities to DeFi enthusiasts and investors alike.\\n\\nAs the DeFi landscape in 2025 continues to mature, these trends provide valuable insight into the future of decentralized finance, shaping how DeFi will impact everything from liquidity pools to asset tokenization.

A range of DeFi protocols implements\\nthese services as a suite of smart contracts, ie software programs that encode the logic of\\nconventional financial operations. Instead of transacting with a counterparty, DeFi users\\nthus interact with software programs that pool the resources of other DeFi users to maintain\\ncontrol over their funds.

He notes that while the underlying idea has merit, most real-world applications are either in their infancy or not meaningfully better than traditional solutions. CZ responds, agreeing with the assessment and adding that many projects slap \"AI\" onto their whitepapers to attract funding, but rarely deliver anything unique. CZ suggests that the space is dominated by vapourware and that the potential is real, but the reality is mostly noise.

                "description": "The image is a screenshot of a discussion between two users, Balaji and CZ, on the intersection of AI and crypto. Balaji initiates the discussion by asking whether the intersection of AI and crypto is full of vaporware or holds merit. Balaji's response states that the intersection is filled with hype and vaporware, with projects using buzzwords to attract investment without offering real technological innovation. However, he acknowledges potential merit in improving blockchain efficiency, security, and smart contract automation. CZ agrees with Balaji's assessment, stating that most projects are marketing fluff. He mentions legitimate use cases like decentralized data marketplaces or using AI for on-chain fraud detection but concludes that the space is dominated by vaporware. The image also includes UI elements such as a duel mode indicator, round number, and a 'Move to Next Round' button.",

This fusion is revolutionizing how we think about money, pushing us beyond simple digital transactions toward an era of intelligent, autonomous financial systems.\nKeep reading to learn more about the following topics:\n* [Understanding the convergence of AI and crypto](#ai-crypto)\n* [The role of AI in today&rsquo;s crypto ecosystem](#ecosystem)\n* [Real-world applications and emerging use cases](#rwas-use-cases)\n* [Challenges and ethical considerations](#a"

We examine the existing ecosystem developments by sector in this report. It is crucial to note that we are still in the early stages of development, and more work needs to be done for widespread adoption, especially regarding the use of AI in crypto applications.\n\n- Within DeFi, we have seen AI being used to augment the smart contract audit process, facilitate trade automation, and be paired with predictive analytics for more accurate forecasts.\n\n- In the NFT space, AI has enabled generative art creation, allowed for intelligent and interactive NFTs, and provided tools to streamline the data analytics process.\n\n- DAOs have also integrated AI to improve manual DAO operations. Additionally, some early developments exist for using autonomous agents to act as delegates for token holders and using AI to power the central DAO smart contract.\n\n- Looking ahead, the intersection of AI and crypto has the potential to unlock a whole new world of possibilities. To provide some perspectives on these possibilities, we explore the views of thought leaders on the future of AI use cases in crypto.\n\n\n* * *\n\n[DOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT HERE](https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/AI-Crypto-Exploring-Use-Cases-and-Possibilities-.pdf)\n\n[Please feel free to share with us any feedback or suggestions you may have via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAQWW1xJAlQiVo_hEOfWU6FpSprZ7QcFA9JL5PV4TKkoJgeg/viewform)\n\n* * *"

Social sentiment is mixed, with bullishness on long-term innovation potential but caution about market hype and project quality.\\n\\nThe \\\"Major News & Developments\\\" section details funding and investment milestones. Lighter raised $68M, Neura Robotics is in talks for €1B, and 10T Holdings allocated $400M. Key details include Ethereum Layer-2 derivatives exchange led by Founders Fund, Tether negotiating to lead an AI robotics funding round, and Dan Tapiero dedicating 20% of a $2B fund to AI-blockchain startups.\\n\\nThe \\\"AI-Powered Crypto Innovation\\\" section covers Giza's ARMA AI Agent Milestone, Lighter's Evolution, and Enterprise Blockchain-AI Integration.

transparency, and use cases within the emerging tech. The convergence of crypto’s efficiency, borderless nature, and programmability with AI has the potential to transform how humans and machines interact with the digital economy, including by enabling users to have sovereignty over their personal data. This includes the rise of the “Agentic Web,” where AI agents operating on crypto infrastructure can drive economic activity and growth.\\nByJonathan King\\n[](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/landing/company)\\nCompany\\n,October 24, 2024\\n[\\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&amp;url=https://www.coinbase.com/blog/demystifying-the-crypto-x-ai-stack)[\\n](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://www.coinbase.com/blog/demystifying-the-crypto-x-ai-stack)[\\n](https://linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://www.coinbase.com/blog/demystifying-the-crypto-x-ai-stack)\\n![Crypto x AI Hero Image.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/sygt3q11s4a9/7raVyLplXCW8aYc0F4lsyV/2d561cd12de952e0bf597912c6fba050/Crypto_x_AI_Hero_Image.png)\\n**Disclosures and footnotes**:**Coinbase Ventures’ portfolio companies are denoted with an asterisk (\\\\*) when first referenced in the article below.**\\nThe future of AI can be built on blockchain technology, as crypto can help increase accessibility, transparency, and use cases within the emerging tech.

We examine the existing ecosystem developments by sector in this report. It is crucial to note that we are still in the early stages of development, and more work needs to be done for widespread adoption, especially regarding the use of AI in crypto applications.\\n\\n- Within DeFi, we have seen AI being used to augment the smart contract audit process, facilitate trade automation, and be paired with predictive analytics for more accurate forecasts.\\n\\n- In the NFT space, AI has enabled generative art creation, allowed for intelligent and interactive NFTs, and provided tools to streamline the data analytics process.\\n\\n- DAOs have also integrated AI to improve manual DAO operations. Additionally, some early developments exist for using autonomous agents to act as delegates for token holders and using AI to power the central DAO smart contract.\\n\\n- Looking ahead, the intersection of AI and crypto has the potential to unlock a whole new world of possibilities.

The Trading Agent searches and evaluates tradeable markets, defines trading strategies, and uses Al Mechs to outsource AI tasks. Al Mechs execute or facilitate the \"hard work\" of AI tasks for a small DAI fee.  The diagram shows a cyclical flow, with Market Creation feeding into Omen (the central hub), which then interacts with the Trading Agent. The Trading Agent, in turn, utilizes Al Mechs to perform tasks. The overall system is designed to create a decentralized, AI-driven prediction market."

A brave new world of autonomous AI agents with human like thinking and learning ability, that are empowered to do useful things for us.\n\nAs many industries adjust to this new paradigm and begin to consider its implications and how best to take advantage of it, a few early adopters are leading the way and demonstrating what might be possible. Interestingly, the crypto industry was one of these first movers and earliest to capitalize on it, but perhaps not in the way you might think. They have some interesting use-cases, some of which may be applicable to the insurance world.\n\n**What is Agentic AI?**\n\nYou can think of Agentic AI as an evolution of GenAI technology where AI Agents are empowered to operate autonomously and take actions on your behalf. These agents are granted access to tools such as public or private databases, the internet, other LLMs and AI models from which they can request information that they deem necessary to arrive at a better decision, and then they take appropriate actions such as executing a trade or updating a business transaction or sending a communication to your customers or even creating a post on social media. Each agent has memory and can reflect on past actions and outcomes. They use this to constantly improve and become increasingly specialized and effective in their focus areas. This suggests that there could be a first mover advantage for certain use-cases.\n\n**What does Agentic AI have to do with Crypto?**\n\nCrypto focused Agentic AI projects started to be appear in late 2023. Today, they have become one of one of the hottest trends or narratives for crypto traders. According to CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency data aggregator, there at least 1,363 AI Agent coins or t"

– Agentic AI Inspiration from the Crypto World\\n\\nWe are on the brink of an Agentic AI revolution. A brave new world of autonomous AI agents with human like thinking and learning ability, that are empowered to do useful things for us.\\n\\nAs many industries adjust to this new paradigm and begin to consider its implications and how best to take advantage of it, a few early adopters are leading the way and demonstrating what might be possible. Interestingly, the crypto industry was one of these first movers and earliest to capitalize on it, but perhaps not in the way you might think. They have some interesting use-cases, some of which may be applicable to the insurance world.\\n\\n**What is Agentic AI?**\\n\\nYou can think of Agentic AI as an evolution of GenAI technology where AI Agents are empowered to operate autonomously and take actions on your behalf. These agents are granted access to tools such as public or private databases, the internet, other LLMs and AI models from which they can request information that they deem necessary to arrive at a better decision, and then they take appropriate actions such as executing a trade or updating a business transaction or sending a communication to your customers or even creating a post on social media. Each agent has memory and can reflect on past actions and outcomes. They use this to constantly improve and become increasingly specialized and effective in their focus areas. This suggests that there could be a first mover advantage for certain use-cases.\\n\\n**What does Agentic AI have to do with Crypto?**\\n\\nCrypto focused Agentic AI projects started to be appear in late 2023. Today, they have become one of one of the hottest trends or narratives for crypto traders. According to CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency data aggregator, there at least 1,363 AI Agent coins or t\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"AI Agent Landscape\",\n    \"url\": \"https://crypto.com/us/research/ai-agent-landscape-dec-2024\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"Authors\",\n    \"text\": \"AI Agent Landscape\\n[![Crypto.com Logo](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/crypto-com.svg)](https://crypto.com/us)\\nCrypto\\n[All Coins](https://crypto.com/us/price)[Baskets](https://crypto.com/us/app/cryptobasket)[Earn](https://crypto.com/us/earn)[Staking](https://crypto.com/us/staking)[Derivatives](https://crypto.com/us/app/derivatives)\\nStocks\\n[All Stocks](https://crypto.com/us/stocks)[Whale Baskets](https://crypto.com/us/stocks)[ETFs](https://crypto.com/us/stocks)\\nPredictions\\n[Sports](https://crypto.com/us/sports)[Financials](https://crypto.com/us/prediction)[Elections](https://crypto.com/us/prediction)[Economics](https://crypto.com/us/prediction)\\n![Crypto.com App](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/main-app-default.svg)\\nCrypto.com AppFor everyday users\\n[Get Started](https://web.crypto.com/hub)\\n![Crypto.com App Download](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/download.svg)\\n![Crypto.com App QR Code](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/crypto-com-qr-code.webp)\\nDownload the app\\n[Crypto](https://crypto.com/us/app)[Stocks](https://crypto.com/us/stocks)[Predictions](https://crypto.com/us/prediction)[Visa Signature® Credit Card](https://crypto.com/us/cards)[Banking](https://crypto.com/us/banking)[Level Up](https://crypto.com/us/levelup)\\n![Exchange](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/exchange-default.svg)\\nExchangeFor advanced traders\\n[Start Trading](https://crypto.com/exchange)\\n![Crypto.com App Download](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/download.svg)\\n![Crypto.com App QR Code](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/exchange-qr-code.svg)\\nDownload the app\\n[Spot Orderbook](https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/BTC_USD)[Trading Bots](https://crypto.com/exchange/trading-bots?type=DCA)[Trading API](https://crypto.com/exchange/api)[OTC](https://crypto.com/exchange/otc)\\n![Onchain](https://mkt-site-asset.crypto.com/assets/logo/onchain-default.svg)\\nOnchainFor web3 enthusiasts\\n[Get Extension](https://chromewebstore.google\"\n  }\n]\n\nExecution Time: 934.83ms\nSearch Parameters: {\n  \"query\": \"what is driving the crypto AI agent narrative\",\n  \"numResults\": 15,\n  \"includeText\": true,\n  \"maxCharacters\": 2000\n}"

For the first time, DeFi became more than just a theoretical idea; it became a concept that worked in practice. During this period, we witnessed a surge in the popularity of several DeFi primitives—DEXes (decentralized exchanges) with [@Uniswap](https://x.com/), borrowing and lending protocols with [@aave](https://x.com/), algorithmic stablecoins with [@SkyEcosystem](https://x.com/), and much more.\n\nSubsequently, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications grew massively. From around $600 million at the beginning of 2020, TVL rose to more than $16 billion by the end of the year and reached a historic all-time high of over $210 billion in December 2021. This growth was also coupled with a strong bull market in the DeFi sector.\n\nchart of crypto TVL from 2020 to end of 2021Source: [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/)\n\nWe could argue that the main catalysts behind this “DeFi Summer” were twofold:\n\n1) Breakthrough advancements in DeFi protocols that made them ready to scale and provided clear use cases.\n\n2) The beginning of a Fed easing cycle, during which interest rates "

[Solana](https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/solana-surpasses-ethereum-in-new-developer-onboarding-for-2024) also experienced a TVL increase of 50% from $6 billion to roughly $9 billion. As the top two ecosystems for DeFi applications, Ethereum and Solana are often viewed as leading indicators of overall DeFi activity.\n\n“Recent momentum in DeFi has been driven by highly-performant L1 ecosystems like Solana, which continues to gain ground thanks to sustained developer activity, improved infrastructure, and rising institutional investment,” Max Kaplan, CTO at SOL Strategies, told The Defiant. “The chain has also rapidly transitioned away from its memecoin-heavy beginnings to a more credible foundation for on-chain structured finance, strengthening investor confidence in its long-term viability.”\n\nKaplan added that the overall health of Solana-based assets has made the ecosystem more attractive to both retail and institutional allocators.\n\nAt the protocol level, [lending platform Aave](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/aave-outperforms-defi-in-q2), currently the largest DeFi protocol with over $29 billion in TVL, has grown 85% since April. Liquid staking protocol Lido, ranking second with $27 billion, is up 80% over the same period. "

For the first time, DeFi became more than just a theoretical idea; it became a concept that worked in practice. During this period, we witnessed a surge in the popularity of several DeFi primitives—DEXes (decentralized exchanges) with [@Uniswap](https://x.com/), borrowing and lending protocols with [@aave](https://x.com/), algorithmic stablecoins with [@SkyEcosystem](https://x.com/), and much more.\\n\\nSubsequently, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications grew massively. From around $600 million at the beginning of 2020, TVL rose to more than $16 billion by the end of the year and reached a historic all-time high of over $210 billion in December 2021. This growth was also coupled with a strong bull market in the DeFi sector.\\n\\nchart of crypto TVL from 2020 to end of 2021Source: [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/)\\n\\nWe could argue that the main catalysts behind this “DeFi Summer” were twofold:\\n\\n1) Breakthrough advancements in DeFi protocols that made them ready to scale and provided clear use cases.\\n\\n2) The beginning of a Fed easing cycle, during which interest rates \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Crypto catalysts: What could spark the next rally?\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLL_zHZuTJE\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-11-13T22:19:33.660Z\",\n    \"author\": \"Yahoo Finance\",\n    \"text\": \"Mizuho Securities managing director and senior analyst, fintech equity research Dan Dolev, The Benchmark Company equity research analyst, fintech and digital assets Mark Palmer, and Coinbase institutional head of strategy John D'Agostino, join Yahoo Finance Invest, detailing how they see bitcoin (BTC-USD) as an investment, the risks involved, and the chances it could fall to zero.\\\\nFor full interviews, highlights, and key insights, check out more from Yahoo Finance Invest.\\\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/topic/yf-in...\\\\n#youtube #crypto #stocks #investing \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout Yahoo Finance:\\\\n\\\\nYahoo Finance provides free stock ticker data, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, comprehensive market data, advanced tools, and more information to help you manage your financial life.\\\\n\\\\nGet the latest news and data at finance.yahoo.com\\\\n\\\\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app on Apple (https://apple.co/3Rten0R) or Android (https://bit.ly/3t8UnXO)\\\\n\\\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on social:\\\\n\\\\nX: / yahoofinance \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/yahoofinanc...\\\\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@yahoofinance?...\\\\nFacebook: / yahoofinance \\\\nLinkedIn: / yahoo-finance\\n| view_count: 8,890 views | short_view_count: 8.8K views | num_likes: 150 likes | num_subscribers: 1.46 million\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"State of DeFi 2025\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.dlnews.com/research/internal/state-of-defi-2025/\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-12-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"text\": \"State of DeFi 2025 –DL News\\nSearch results\\n[](https://www.dlnews.com/)\\n[](https://www.dlnews.com/research/)\\n[](https://www.dlnews.com/research/)\\nSearch results\\n[![Dark Defi llama logo](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dlnews/426DI37ZRBECRO2PQU7KF274RQ.webp)![Light Defi llama logo](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dlnews/IUU22VCUDRHULN77J7XD764UCM.webp)](https://defillama.com/)\\n[![Dark Defi llama logo](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dlnews/426DI37ZRBECRO2PQU7KF274RQ.webp)![Light Defi llama logo](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dlnews/IUU22VCUDRHULN77J7XD764UCM.webp)](https://defillama.com/)\\n[](https://www.dlnews.com/)\\nDL Research Content\\n# State of DeFi 2025\\n![State of DeFi 2025](https://www.dlnews.com/resizer/v2/UNUJ2VPHAFFILCYJIAJ5574454.jpg?auth=cf2dc6666aeb28b9d11ef483cf212b3b62a9528624c9116bfabb497ecfe8c781&amp;width=1200&amp;height=675&amp;focal=825%2C540)\\nState of DeFi 2025.\\n[Home](https://www.dlnews.com/)State of DeFi 2025\\nBy\\n[DL Research](https://www.dlnews.com/researchteam/dlresearch/)\\n23 December 2025 at 18:53\\nShare\\nTable of contents\\n[Executive summary: DeFi in 2025](#executive-summary-defi-in-2025)\\n[Stablecoins](#stablecoins)\\n[The Regulatory Shift: Clarity Unlocks Institutional Adoption](#the-regulatory-shift-clarity-unlocks-institutional-adoption)\\n[The Technology Shift: Stablecoins Become an Infrastructure Layer](#the-technology-shift-stablecoins-become-an-infrastructure-layer)\\n[The Usage Shift: Payments, Safety and Yield](#the-usage-shift-payments-safety-and-yield)\\n[Stablecoins Enter the Mainstream Financial Layer](#stablecoins-enter-the-mainstream-financial-layer)\\n[Capital And Revenue Map: Who Earned, Who Faded](#capital-and-revenue-map-who-earned-who-faded)\\n[Trading Stack: Perps, Spot, And Primary Issuance Rails](#trading-stack-perps-spot-and-primary-issuance-rails)\\n[Credit, Yield, Staking, Restaking, And RWA Collateral](#credit-yield-staking-restaking-a\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"2025 ONCHAIN REVENUE REPORT:<br/>From Mania to Maturity\",\n    \"url\": \"https://1kx.capital/writing/2025-onchain-revenue-report\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-10-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"Lasse Clausen, Christopher Heymann, Robert Koschig, Clare He, Johannes Säuberlich\",\n    \"text\": \"2025 ONCHAIN REVENUE REPORT: From Mania to Maturity -

                "description": "The image provides a technical analysis of the Solana-based memecoin $PUMP. It includes an overview, technical analysis, and investment notes. The overview states that $PUMP is a Solana memecoin with heavy derivatives attention and frequent whale activity. Recent data shows platform revenue declining from ~$7M (Jan) to ~$533K (Jul). The overall analysis indicates a neutral-to-bearish near-term bias, with a price decrease of -10.43% over 24h. Technical indicators include neutral-to-weak RSI, bearish MACD, and a drifting lower SMA(7). Bollinger Bands are expanding, and the OBV is flat-to-slipping. The market cap is ~$2.80B. Spot snapshot: Price ~$0.00280, 24h tx count 5,254, holders 67,184, liquidity ~$7.45M. Support is at $0.00255-0.00260, then $0.00220. Resistance is at $0.00305-0.00310, then $0.00335-0.00340. The summary suggests a trend with expanding volatility, recommending watching for a reclaim and hold above ~$0.00310. Fundamentals and news: The ecosystem is memecoin/speculative, and adoption depends on Solana flows and social/derivatives positioning. Revenue trend: Reported platform revenue compression raises questions about sustained fundamentals. Solana backdrop: SOL strength can improve beta, but $PUMP remains flow-driven. Professional investment note: Tactical buys: Consider only on reclaim/close above ~$0.00310 with rising volume; aim for ~$0.00335-0.00340, then trail stops. Risk management: If entering near current levels, keep tight invalidation below ~$0.00255; size small due to memecoin volatility and mixed fundamentals. For swing shorts: Only if a bounce into ~$0.00335 fails on weakening volume; avoid shorting into whale-driven squeezes. The image also suggests requesting a technical analysis for $PUMP and provides an example of how to buy the token.",

However, the ecosystem’s early stages were dominated by meme coins and speculative projects, which, while drawing attention, posed questions about the network’s long-term sustainability.    Recently, there has been a significant shift towards more sustainable growth in the Solana ecosystem, focusing on real-world use cases and robust development. This blog will delve into Solana’s significant transition, highlighting its technological advancements and the burgeoning DeFi scene within its ecosystem. We’ll explore how DeFi development companies are tapping into Solana’s high-speed and low-cost infrastructure to drive innovation and growth. Additionally, the discussion will cover the increasing focus on sustainable projects that not only promise returns but also contribute positively to the blockchain landscape. DeFi Development Company Our team of expert is on hand to assist you The Rise of Solana: From Memecoin Mania to Prominence In the early days of Solana, the ecosystem was flooded with meme coins, riding the wave of speculative interest in cryptocurrencies. Memecoins, often created as jokes or to capitalize on trends, brought a lot of attention and trading volume to Solana but also led to volatility and concerns about the long-term health of the ecosystem. Despite this initial wave of speculative assets, Solana’s underlying technology began to attract severe developers and projects. Its high throughput, dApps Development Company’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second, and significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum make it a prime candidate for DeFi applications and NFTs. As the market matured, there was a clear shift from memecoin-driven hype to projects focused on sustainability and real-world utility. The Eme"

At first glance, investing in something with no inherent value seems illogical. Yet, these tokens have repeatedly attracted millions of dollars, driven entirely by collective excitement and the willingness of communities to pool resources.\n**Cryptocurrency launchpad Pump.fun, built on Solana**, supercharged the memecoin boom by letting anyone create and trade tokens instantly. This near-frictionless system triggered a surge of hyper-fast launches, with some coins briefly hitting multi-million-dollar valuations. Quickly, the platform became the busiest hub for*&#8216;pumping&#8217;*memecoins, becoming a symbol of the 2025 memecoin boom, particularly on crypto Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.\nTo dive deeply into memecoin pump-and-dump behaviours, the team at[**BestBrokers**](https://www.bestbrokers.com/)set out to track these wallets and tokens, noting liquidity spikes, hype cycles, and patterns that mirrored the wider market. We also analysed additional market data from cryptocurrency analytics platform CoinMarketCap to assess broader trends and valuation dynamics. Fresh data suggests memecoins on Pump.fun may now be following the path of NFTs: the speculative frenzy is cooling as liquidity thins and traders grow more cautious.\n**Key findings from the report:**\n* Global memecoin market capitalisation**fell 61%**in the past year, from $93.09 billion in January 2025 to just $36.51 billion by January 2026, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n* New token launches on Pump.fun fell sharply from a peak of**70,000 per day**in Janu"

              "text": "The world of crypto is buzzing with meme coins, and let’s face it, they’re the wild card of the investment universe. Enter Stonks (STNK), a Solana-based meme coin that's as playful as its name suggests. But is there more to it than just a few laughs and some memes? Let’s break it down. \n Meme Coins: The Wild West of Crypto \n Meme coins have become a phenomenon, mixing humor with the high-stakes game of crypto investing. They thrive on internet culture, viral trends, and social media buzz. Stonks is a perfect example, riding the wave of memes and community spirit. But can it sustain itself as a long-term investment? \n The Speculative Roller Coaster \n Let’s get one thing straight: Stonks (STNK) and its fellow meme coins are speculative by nature. Their value skyrockets and plummets based on social media trends and market sentiment, not on any real-world utility. This creates a volatile landscape that can be thrilling, but also terrifying. \n High-Risk, High-Reward? \n Investing in meme coins is a gamble. Prices can soar overnight thanks to viral posts or influencer shoutouts, but they can also crash just as quickly. Stonks has shown us both sides of this coin—literally. You can either make a killing or watch your investment evaporate before your eyes. \n No Foundation to Stand On \n Unlike more established cryptocurrencies, meme coins often lack a clear use case. Stonks, while leveraging Solana's speed, is still mostly about the memes and the community cheering it on. At its core, it's more about the hype than anything else. \n The Community Connection \n What makes meme coins like Stonks interesting is the cultural connection they have. They tap into internet humor, creating a lighthearted and engaging atmosphere that’s hard to resist. \n Driven by Community \n Stonks has built a community that’s passionate and engaged. This community is what keeps the coin alive and thriving. But let's be real: what happens if they all decide to move on to the next meme? \n Social Media Supe"

Memecoins have increased Solana's transaction volume and liquidity, but this activity is unsustainable and could lead to market corrections. Solana's valuation metrics suggest it trades at a premium, with much recent activity tied to speculative memecoin trading rather than long-term use cases. Investors should approach Solana with caution, considering gradual dollar-cost averaging out as the memecoin hype fades to mitigate potential risks. Looking for a helping hand in the market?

Solana, a high-performance blockchain ecosystem, has played a pivotal role in the growth of memecoins, contributing significantly to its decentralized app (dApp) revenue and overall ecosystem expansion. However, the rise of Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer-2 network, has introduced new competition, sparking debates about ecosystem dominance and innovation.\n\n## Base vs. Solana: Competing for Memecoin Ecosystem Dominance\n\nThe rivalry between Solana and Base has intensified as both ecosystems compete for memecoin dominance. Solana remains a leading blockchain ecosystem, generating $1.6 billion in dApp revenue during the first half of 2025, with memecoins accounting for 62% of this revenue. Meanwhile, Base has rapidly gained traction, capturing 16.8% of investor interest in 2024 and introducing innovative concepts like contentcoins.\n\n### Zora's Role in Token Creation and User Growth\n\nA key driver of Base's growth is Zora, which accounted for 44.6% of token creation activity on the network. With over 2 million monthly active users and significant growth in new user adoption, Zora has become a cornerstone of Base's ecosystem. This surge in activity underscores the growing appeal of Base as a platform for launching memecoins and other tokenized assets.\n\n## Economic Impact of Memecoins on Solana's Ecosystem\n\nDespite criticism from Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who referred to memecoins and NFTs as \"digital slop,\" these assets have significantly contributed to Solana's revenue. Memecoins alone generated $1.6 billion in the first half of 2025, highlighting their economic importance. This duality—criticism from leade"

Using on-chain data, it is explored how retail-focused token creation platforms are reshaping blockchain ecosystems and influencing market participation. This study finds that Pump.fun accounted for up to 71.1% of all tokens minted on Solana and contributed 40–67.4% of total DEX transactions. Despite this activity, fewer than 2% of tokens successfully transitioned to major decentralized exchanges, highlighting a highly speculative market structure. The platform experienced rapid growth, with daily active users rising from 60,000 to peaks of 260,000, underscoring strong retail adoption. This reflects a broader shift towards accessible, socially-driven market participation enabled by memecoins. However, while memecoins lower entry barriers and encourage retail engagement, they introduce significant risks. The volatile and speculative nature of these platforms raises concerns about long-term sustainability and the resilience of the blockchain ecosystem. These findings reveal the dual impact of memecoins: they democratize token creation and alter market dynamics but may jeopardize market efficiency and stability. This paper highlights the need to critically assess the implications of retail-driven speculative trading and its potential to disrupt emerging blockchain economies.\n## IIntroduction\nThe blockchain ecosystem has witnessed several transformative waves of innovation since its inception.

It includes an overview, technical analysis, and investment notes. The overview states that $PUMP is a Solana memecoin with heavy derivatives attention and frequent whale activity. Recent data shows platform revenue declining from ~$7M (Jan) to ~$533K (Jul). The overall analysis indicates a neutral-to-bearish near-term bias, with a price decrease of -10.43% over 24h. Technical indicators include neutral-to-weak RSI, bearish MACD, and a drifting lower SMA(7). Bollinger Bands are expanding, and the OBV is flat-to-slipping. The market cap is ~$2.80B. Spot snapshot: Price ~$0.00280, 24h tx count 5,254, holders 67,184, liquidity ~$7.45M. Support is at $0.00255-0.00260, then $0.00220. Resistance is at $0.00305-0.00310, then $0.00335-0.00340. The summary suggests a trend with expanding volatility, recommending watching for a reclaim and hold above ~$0.00310. Fundamentals and news: The ecosystem is memecoin/speculative, and adoption depends on Solana flows and social/derivatives positioning. Revenue trend: Reported platform revenue compression raises questions about sustained fundamentals. Solana backdrop: SOL strength can improve beta, but $PUMP remains flow-driven. Professional investment note: Tactical buys: Consider only on reclaim/close above ~$0.00310 with rising volume; aim for ~$0.00335-0.00340, then trail stops. Risk management: If entering near current levels, keep tight invalidation below ~$0.00255; size small due to memecoin volatility and mixed fundamentals. For swing shorts: Only if a bounce into ~$0.00335 fails on weakening volume; avoid shorting into whale-driven squeezes.

Memecoins, often created as jokes or to capitalize on trends, brought a lot of attention and trading volume to Solana but also led to volatility and concerns about the long-term health of the ecosystem. Despite this initial wave of speculative assets, Solana’s underlying technology began to attract severe developers and projects. Its high throughput, dApps Development Company’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second, and significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum make it a prime candidate for DeFi applications and NFTs.

At first glance, investing in something with no inherent value seems illogical. Yet, these tokens have repeatedly attracted millions of dollars, driven entirely by collective excitement and the willingness of communities to pool resources.\\n**Cryptocurrency launchpad Pump.fun, built on Solana**, supercharged the memecoin boom by letting anyone create and trade tokens instantly. This near-frictionless system triggered a surge of hyper-fast launches, with some coins briefly hitting multi-million-dollar valuations. Quickly, the platform became the busiest hub for*&#8216;pumping&#8217;*memecoins, becoming a symbol of the 2025 memecoin boom, particularly on crypto Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.\\nTo dive deeply into memecoin pump-and-dump behaviours, the team at[**BestBrokers**](https://www.bestbrokers.com/)set out to track these wallets and tokens, noting liquidity spikes, hype cycles, and patterns that mirrored the wider market. We also analysed additional market data from cryptocurrency analytics platform CoinMarketCap to assess broader trends and valuation dynamics.

Enter Stonks (STNK), a Solana-based meme coin that's as playful as its name suggests. But is there more to it than just a few laughs and some memes? Let’s break it down. \\n Meme Coins: The Wild West of Crypto \\n Meme coins have become a phenomenon, mixing humor with the high-stakes game of crypto investing. They thrive on internet culture, viral trends, and social media buzz. Stonks is a perfect example, riding the wave of memes and community spirit. But can it sustain itself as a long-term investment? \\n The Speculative Roller Coaster \\n Let’s get one thing straight: Stonks (STNK) and its fellow meme coins are speculative by nature. Their value skyrockets and plummets based on social media trends and market sentiment, not on any real-world utility. This creates a volatile landscape that can be thrilling, but also terrifying. \\n High-Risk, High-Reward? \\n Investing in meme coins is a gamble. Prices can soar overnight thanks to viral posts or influencer shoutouts, but they can also crash just as quickly. Stonks has shown us both sides of this coin—literally. You can either make a killing or watch your investment evaporate before your eyes. \\n No Foundation to Stand On \\n Unlike more established cryptocurrencies, meme coins often lack a clear use case. Stonks, while leveraging Solana's speed, is still mostly about the memes and the community cheering it on. At its core, it's more about the hype than anything else. \\n The Community Connection \\n What makes meme coins like Stonks interesting is the cultural connection they have.

Memecoins have increased Solana's transaction volume and liquidity, but this activity is unsustainable and could lead to market corrections. Solana's valuation metrics suggest it trades at a premium, with much recent activity tied to speculative memecoin trading rather than long-term use cases. Investors should approach Solana with caution, considering gradual dollar-cost averaging out as the memecoin hype fades to mitigate potential risks. Looking for a helping hand in the market?

Solana, a high-performance blockchain ecosystem, has played a pivotal role in the growth of memecoins, contributing significantly to its decentralized app (dApp) revenue and overall ecosystem expansion. However, the rise of Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer-2 network, has introduced new competition, sparking debates about ecosystem dominance and innovation.\\n\\n## Base vs. Solana: Competing for Memecoin Ecosystem Dominance\\n\\nThe rivalry between Solana and Base has intensified as both ecosystems compete for memecoin dominance. Solana remains a leading blockchain ecosystem, generating $1.6 billion in dApp revenue during the first half of 2025, with memecoins accounting for 62% of this revenue. Meanwhile, Base has rapidly gained traction, capturing 16.8% of investor interest in 2024 and introducing innovative concepts like contentcoins.\\n\\n### Zora's Role in Token Creation and User Growth\\n\\nA key driver of Base's growth is Zora, which accounted for 44.6% of token creation activity on the network. With over 2 million monthly active users and significant growth in new user adoption, Zora has become a cornerstone of Base's ecosystem. This surge in activity underscores the growing appeal of Base as a platform for launching memecoins and other tokenized assets.\\n\\n## Economic Impact of Memecoins on Solana's Ecosystem\\n\\nDespite criticism from Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who referred to memecoins and NFTs as \\\"digital slop,\\\" these assets have significantly contributed to Solana's revenue.

These playful, community-driven tokens are not just speculative assets—they are cultural phenomena driving engagement and innovation within the Solana ecosystem. But what makes Solana&#x27;s memecoin ecosystem so unique, and why is it gaining traction?\\n## What Are Memecoins?\\nMemecoins are cryptocurrency tokens inspired by internet memes, humor, or cultural trends. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, memecoins often prioritize community engagement and viral momentum over technical utility.

Using on-chain data, it is explored how retail-focused token creation platforms are reshaping blockchain ecosystems and influencing market participation. This study finds that Pump.fun accounted for up to 71.1% of all tokens minted on Solana and contributed 40–67.4% of total DEX transactions. Despite this activity, fewer than 2% of tokens successfully transitioned to major decentralized exchanges, highlighting a highly speculative market structure. The platform experienced rapid growth, with daily active users rising from 60,000 to peaks of 260,000, underscoring strong retail adoption. This reflects a broader shift towards accessible, socially-driven market participation enabled by memecoins. However, while memecoins lower entry barriers and encourage retail engagement, they introduce significant risks. The volatile and speculative nature of these platforms raises concerns about long-term sustainability and the resilience of the blockchain ecosystem. These findings reveal the dual impact of memecoins: they democratize token creation and alter market dynamics but may jeopardize market efficiency and stability. This paper highlights the need to critically assess the implications of retail-driven speculative trading and its potential to disrupt emerging blockchain economies.\\n## IIntroduction\\nThe blockchain ecosystem has witnessed several transformative waves of innovation since its inception.

              "text": "\n \n Will Base L2 Sustain Its Momentum as a Rising Star Infrastructure? \n In this blog, we delve into the explosive growth and future prospects of BASE, a layer 2 platform under Coinbase. Over the past month, the BASE ecosystem has experienced a remarkable surge, with over 4.75 million transactions and more than 400,000 sign ups in a short month. This frenzy of activity can be attributed to the skyrocketing popularity of memecoins. Through this article, we aim to explore the reasons behind this surge, examine its subsequent trajectory, and highlight the crucial factors that demand attention amidst this extraordinary growth. \n What’s causing the rise? \n \n The surge in activity on the Base blockchain can be attributed to the explosive popularity of meme coins. Tokens like TOSHI, TYBG, NORMIE, and BRETT have witnessed astounding price increases, resulting in cumulative trading volumes surpassing $1 billion. \n \n Source: Nguyen Viet Phong, Medium \n Further basing on the timeline of Base events above, Base gained significant traction and momentum from the memecoin mania. This phenomenon has propelled Base to experience a significant surge in transactional activity, the emergence of numerous unique addresses, and a substantial amount of locked funds. This remarkable growth, coupled with the advantage of direct access from Coinbase, positions Base as an attractive choice for new retail users, potentially making it their first foray into blockchain networks. \n \n Moreover, the trend has spurred the migration of other memecoins to Base, further amplifying its expansion. Nevertheless, the widespread appeal of meme coins has presented certain obstacles, notably the issue of elevated gas fees and network congestion, which has been further intensified by the participation of trading bots. The majority of the transactions originated from meme coin trading, with trading bots specifically programmed to acquire tokens shortly after their release, contributing to network congestion. \n C"

Who would have thought Base would become a home for memecoin projects? In addition to the memecoin project, several promising projects have emerged within the Base ecosystem. HHow extensive is the development of the Base ecosystem, and what are its future prospects? Check out the full review in the following article.\n\n### Article Summary\n\n- 🔥 Base has become the third largest Layer-2 protocol with a market share of 14.17%\n- 🚀 Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has tripled to reach US$1.525 billion by 2024.\n- 📊 Recent months have witnessed a twofold surge in daily transactions and daily active addresses within Base.\n- 🏆 The Base ecosystem’s rapid growth is fueled by memecoin enthusiasm and promising protocols like Aerodrome, Heroes of Mavia, Virtual Protocol, Farcaster, and Friend.tech.\n\n## About Base\n\nBase is a Coinbase-built layer-2 (L2) [blockchain](https://pintu.co.id/en/academy/glossary/blockchain), allowing developer teams to create a secure, low-cost, and friendly protocol. The project is built using Optimism’s OP Stack technology. As a result, Base inherits Optimism’s optimistic roll-up technology for its transaction processing.\n\nBase’s mainnet operates independently from Optimism’s network. However, by using the OP Stack, the Base network will be able to connect with the L2 network in the Optimism Superchain ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, Base also supports the implementation of account abstraction. In other words, developers can create applications that execute transactions without performing man"

This year, we’re focusing on growing the Base economy by investing in five key pillars: builders, apps, ownership, markets, and bringing everyone, everywhere, onchain. We have a plan — but we can only achieve our ambitious goals by building with all of you. As we collaborate and grow, our strategies will continue to evolve to better serve the Base economy._\n\n## Our mission\n\nOur mission is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom. A new internet, built by the people, for the people.\n\nSuccess looks like the whole world onchain — millions of builders and billions of people — and the only way we get there is by connecting people, builders, and businesses. By inviting the world to build alongside us and building in the open, we’re creating a new kind of internet that supports an open, thriving economy for everyone.\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of feedback we consistently hear is that it’s still too hard to join this new economy. This year, we’re focused on simplifying the message, making the products just work, and bringing the whole world onchain.\n\n## Our big, hairy, audacious goals for 2025\n\nTo bring a billion people onchain, we have to work hard and push ourselves beyond our comfort zones. If we’re hitting every milestone we set, we’re not aiming high enough. So, as we enter 2025, we set some big, hairy, audacious goals that both excite and scare us:\n\n- 25 million people\n\n- 25 thousand developers\n\n- 250 Mgas/s blockspace capacity\n\n- $100 billion assets on platform\n\n- 1 billion transactions on Base in October\n\n\nWhen we lo"

Over the past month, the BASE ecosystem has experienced a remarkable surge, with over 4.75 million transactions and more than 400,000 sign ups in a short month. This frenzy of activity can be attributed to the skyrocketing popularity of memecoins. Through this article, we aim to explore the reasons behind this surge, examine its subsequent trajectory, and highlight the crucial factors that demand attention amidst this extraordinary growth. \\n What’s causing the rise? \\n \\n The surge in activity on the Base blockchain can be attributed to the explosive popularity of meme coins. Tokens like TOSHI, TYBG, NORMIE, and BRETT have witnessed astounding price increases, resulting in cumulative trading volumes surpassing $1 billion. \\n \\n Source: Nguyen Viet Phong, Medium \\n Further basing on the timeline of Base events above, Base gained significant traction and momentum from the memecoin mania. This phenomenon has propelled Base to experience a significant surge in transactional activity, the emergence of numerous unique addresses, and a substantial amount of locked funds. This remarkable growth, coupled with the advantage of direct access from Coinbase, positions Base as an attractive choice for new retail users, potentially making it their first foray into blockchain networks. \\n \\n Moreover, the trend has spurred the migration of other memecoins to Base, further amplifying its expansion. Nevertheless, the widespread appeal of meme coins has presented certain obstacles, notably the issue of elevated gas fees and network congestion, which has been further intensified by the participation of trading bots. The majority of the transactions originated from meme coin trading, with trading bots specifically programmed to acquire tokens shortly after their release, contributing to network congestion. \\n C\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Why Base, Why Now?

Reading Time 8 Minute\\n\\nReading Time: 8minutes\\n\\nBase, Coinbase’s Layer-2 protocol, has taken the spotlight with a significant surge in metrics . Who would have thought Base would become a home for memecoin projects? In addition to the memecoin project, several promising projects have emerged within the Base ecosystem. HHow extensive is the development of the Base ecosystem, and what are its future prospects? Check out the full review in the following article.\\n\\n### Article Summary\\n\\n- 🔥 Base has become the third largest Layer-2 protocol with a market share of 14.17%\\n- 🚀 Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has tripled to reach US$1.525 billion by 2024.\\n- 📊 Recent months have witnessed a twofold surge in daily transactions and daily active addresses within Base.\\n- 🏆 The Base ecosystem’s rapid growth is fueled by memecoin enthusiasm and promising protocols like Aerodrome, Heroes of Mavia, Virtual Protocol, Farcaster, and Friend.tech.\\n\\n## About Base\\n\\nBase is a Coinbase-built layer-2 (L2) [blockchain](https://pintu.co.id/en/academy/glossary/blockchain), allowing developer teams to create a secure, low-cost, and friendly protocol. The project is built using Optimism’s OP Stack technology. As a result, Base inherits Optimism’s optimistic roll-up technology for its transaction processing.\\n\\nBase’s mainnet operates independently from Optimism’s network. However, by using the OP Stack, the Base network will be able to connect with the L2 network in the Optimism Superchain ecosystem.\\n\\nAdditionally, Base also supports the implementation of account abstraction. In other words, developers can create applications that execute transactions without performing man\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Base: Bringing Future of Consumer Applications - Four Pillars\",\n    \"url\": \"https://4pillars.io/en/articles/base\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2024-05-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"text\": \"May 30, 2024 · 39min read\\n\\nBase: Bringing Future of Consumer Applications\\n\\nInfra\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\n![Project Thumbnail](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpvqzbubisqiqxdolbyuc.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fprojects%2Fbase.jpg&w=32&q=75)Base\\n\\n![Article Thumbnail](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuycfsrwjjlylklhfgho.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1717035070488.png&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n[![JW profile](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuycfsrwjjlylklhfgho.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fpillarbear.jpeg&w=48&q=75)JW](https://4pillars.io/researchers/JW) [![ISKRA profile](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuycfsrwjjlylklhfgho.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fiskra.jpeg&w=48&q=75)ISKRA](https://4pillars.io/researchers/ISKRA)\\n\\n[![linked-in-logo](https://4pillars.io/_next/static/media/linked-in-logo.e02e8416.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://4pillars.io/en/articles/base)[![x-logo](https://4pillars.io/_next/static/media/x-logo.f9e03233.svg)](https://x.com/intent/tweet?url=https://4pillars.io/en/articles/base)\\n\\n[![JW profile](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuycfsrwjjlylklhfgho.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fpillarbear.jpeg&w=48&q=75)JW](https://4pillars.io/researchers/JW) [![ISKRA profile](https://4pillars.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuycfsrwjjlylklhfgho.supabase.co%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fiskra.jpeg&w=48&q=75)ISKRA](https://4pillars.io/researchers/ISKRA)\\n\\n[![linked-in-logo](https://4pillars.io/_next/static/media/linked-in-logo.e02e8416.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://4pillars.io/en/articles/base)[![x-logo](https://4pillars.io/_next/static/media/x-logo.f9e03233.svg)](https://x.com/intent/tweet?url=https://4pillars.io/en/articles/base)\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\n1\\\\.

This year, we’re focusing on growing the Base economy by investing in five key pillars: builders, apps, ownership, markets, and bringing everyone, everywhere, onchain. We have a plan — but we can only achieve our ambitious goals by building with all of you. As we collaborate and grow, our strategies will continue to evolve to better serve the Base economy._\\n\\n## Our mission\\n\\nOur mission is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom. A new internet, built by the people, for the people.\\n\\nSuccess looks like the whole world onchain — millions of builders and billions of people — and the only way we get there is by connecting people, builders, and businesses. By inviting the world to build alongside us and building in the open, we’re creating a new kind of internet that supports an open, thriving economy for everyone.\\n\\nOne of the biggest pieces of feedback we consistently hear is that it’s still too hard to join this new economy. This year, we’re focused on simplifying the message, making the products just work, and bringing the whole world onchain.\\n\\n## Our big, hairy, audacious goals for 2025\\n\\nTo bring a billion people onchain, we have to work hard and push ourselves beyond our comfort zones. If we’re hitting every milestone we set, we’re not aiming high enough. So, as we enter 2025, we set some big, hairy, audacious goals that both excite and scare us:\\n\\n- 25 million people\\n\\n- 25 thousand developers\\n\\n- 250 Mgas/s blockspace capacity\\n\\n- $100 billion assets on platform\\n\\n- 1 billion transactions on Base in October\\n\\n\\nWhen we lo\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Electric Capital Developer Report - Base\",\n    \"url\": \"https://developerreport.com/ecosystems/base-coinbase-chain\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"text\": \"[2024 Developer Report is live!\\\\\\n\\\\\\nExplore](https://developerreport.com/developer-report)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\nSearchOpen sidebar\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Base Could Bring a Billion People Onchain: Base’s Global Growth Lead on Builders, DEX Trading, and Why User Experience Is the Next Frontier\",\n    \"url\": \"https://coinspaidmedia.com/business/xen-baynham-herd-base-coinbase-interview/\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"Nadiia Yakubets\",\n    \"text\": \"Xen Baynham-Herd on Base’s Growth, Coinbase Strategy, and L2 Futures\\n[Home](https://coinspaidmedia.com/)&gt;[Business](https://coinspaidmedia.com/business/)&gt;\\nBase Could Bring a Billion People Onchain: Base’s Global Growth Lead on Builders, DEX Trading, and Why User Experience Is the Next Frontier\\n# Base Could Bring a Billion People Onchain: Base’s Global Growth Lead on Builders, DEX Trading, and Why User Experience Is the Next Frontier\\nDecember 4, 2025 ·11 min read\\n[\\nNadiia Yakubets\\nEditorial Director @ CoinsPaid Media\\n](https://coinspaidmedia.com/contributors/nadiia-yakubets/)\\n![Xen Baynham-Herd on Base’s Growth, Coinbase Strategy, and L2 Futures](https://coinspaidmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/base_could_bring_a_billion_people_onchain__bases_global_growth_lead_on_builders_dex_trading_and_why_user_experience_is_the_next_frontier_main-720x496.webp)\\nCrypto market leans into real-world adoption, and on-chain activity hits new highs.[Base](https://x.com/base?utm_source=coinspaidmedia.com&#038;utm_medium=referral), Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network for Ethereum, is emerging as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in Web3.\\nAs[Base accelerates](https://coinspaidmedia.com/news/coinbase-wallet-becomes-base-app-superapp/)its global expansion and prepares to onboard the next generation of builders and users, the conversation around its long-term vision is more relevant than ever.\\nWe sat down with[Xen Baynham-Herd](https://x.com/XenBH?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author&#038;utm_source=coinspaidmedia.com&#038;utm_medium=referral), Base&rsquo;s Head of Global Growth, to understand what this future looks like and what it will take to bring millions, perhaps billions, into the on-chain economy.

Introduction: A New Architecture for Global Finance\nThe tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) is not merely an incremental technological advancement; it represents a fundamental re-architecture of global finance. This process, which transforms rights to tangible and financial assets into programmable digital tokens on a blockchain, has moved decisively from a conceptual phase to a multi-billion-dollar reality. By unlocking unprecedented liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility for assets ranging from private credit to real estate, RWA tokenization is laying the groundwork for a more interconnected and efficient global market.\nThe institutional significance of this trend is profound, a sentiment echoed by leaders at the highest levels of the financial industry.\n*\"The next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\"*\n*— LARRY FINK, CEO & CHAIRMAN, BLACKROCK*\nThis primer provides a comprehensive analysis of the RWA market to enable strategic decision-making. It examines key market data, evaluates the leading asset classes driving growth, maps the evolving global regulatory landscape, and identifies the core ecosystem of players and tech"

As institutional adoption accelerates and regulatory frameworks evolve, RWAs are set to become a multi-trillion-dollar market.\n\n### What is Real-World Asset Tokenization?\n\n[Real-world asset](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2F101blockchains%2Ecom%2Freal-world-assets-rwa-in-crypto%2F&urlhash=hCbe&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) tokenization refers to the process of representing ownership of physical or traditional financial assets on a blockchain in the form of digital tokens. These tokens provide fractional ownership, improved liquidity, and enhanced accessibility to global markets. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are purely digital, RWA tokens are backed by tangible or financial assets, making them a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy.\n\n### Key Benefits of RWA Tokenization\n\n1.

As of 2024 the total RWA value increased nearly 37% year-to-date and 2,327% over the past three years.\nBut what are RWAs, and what is the benefit of tokenising them? Let's find out together in this article!\n## **Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenisation 101**\nReal-world assets (RWAs) are tangible instruments that exist in the physical world that are later brought on-chain through tokenisation. Examples include treasury bills, real estate, invoices, money-market funds, and carbon credits.\nAs part of the tokenisation process, something of value is captured with a token that resides on a blockchain and this token can be held in cryptocurrency wallets and utilised in decentralised applications (dApps).\nWith tokenisation, RWAs could be transformed into digital assets that retain all the advantages of cryptocurrencies (e.g., public-key cryptography, transparency, traceability, and peer-to-peer transfers) whil"

Complete Tokenization Guide 2025\nRWA tokenization grew 380% to $24B as BlackRock and JPMorgan bring assets on-chain. Learn how tokenized yields reach 4-12% APY.\n![What Are Real-World Assets (RWA)? Complete Tokenization Guide 2025](https://www.23stud.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feu-west-2.graphassets.com%2Fcm2fami7q008a01wfgzmm4lf7%2Fcmcit56k9otrf08mj818hkde9&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75)\nReal-World Assets (RWA) exploded from $5B to $24B by June 2025 (380% growth), becoming crypto&#x27;s second fastest-growing sector. BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo now operate production-scale platforms, with tokenized Treasuries at $7.5B and private credit at $14B. Key benefits: 24/7 trading, fractional ownership starting at $1,000, instant settlement, and 4-12% yields. The ecosystem spans Ethereum (59% share), ZKsync Era (private credit), and Solana (retail access). Industry projections: $16 trillion tokenized by 2030.\n## What Are Real-World Assets (RWA)? The Financial Revolution Happening Right Now\n**Quick answer:**Real-World Assets (RWAs) are traditional financial and physical assets represented as digital tokens on blockchain networks, enabling 24/7 global trading, fractional ownership, and programmable features impossible in conventional finance.\nTraditional finance meets blockchain innovation as institutional assets migrate to programmable networks, creating unprecedented opportunities for global access, 24/7 trading, and automated financial services. The transformation is happening at unprecedented speed with measurable, substantial results.\nImagine being able to own a fraction of a government bond, commercial real estate, or private credit fund with the same ease as sending a text message.

It is expected to disrupt nearly every industry and sector of our modern society –from investing and asset management, through manufacturing to real estate or even art. We conservatively estimate that the total market value of tokenized assets will significantly exceed USD 10 trillion by 2030. In this article, we lay out the basics of tokenization, share our view on the main use cases, as well as discuss what you need to consider for your business.**\n![Tokenization](https://img.rolandberger.com/content_assets/content_images/captions/Roland_Berger_INS_1164_Tokenization_IT_image_caption_none.jpg?v=861438)\n### What is tokenization?\nTokenization promises to redefine asset ownership and investment and we might just be on the cusp of a major breakthrough in its[global adoption](https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Insights/Publications/Should-Europe-develop-into-a-token-e"

Introduction: A New Architecture for Global Finance\\nThe tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) is not merely an incremental technological advancement; it represents a fundamental re-architecture of global finance. This process, which transforms rights to tangible and financial assets into programmable digital tokens on a blockchain, has moved decisively from a conceptual phase to a multi-billion-dollar reality. By unlocking unprecedented liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility for assets ranging from private credit to real estate, RWA tokenization is laying the groundwork for a more interconnected and efficient global market.\\nThe institutional significance of this trend is profound, a sentiment echoed by leaders at the highest levels of the financial industry.\\n*\\\"The next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\\\"*\\n*— LARRY FINK, CEO & CHAIRMAN, BLACKROCK*\\nThis primer provides a comprehensive analysis of the RWA market to enable strategic decision-making.

As of 2024 the total RWA value increased nearly 37% year-to-date and 2,327% over the past three years.\\nBut what are RWAs, and what is the benefit of tokenising them? Let's find out together in this article!\\n## **Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenisation 101**\\nReal-world assets (RWAs) are tangible instruments that exist in the physical world that are later brought on-chain through tokenisation. Examples include treasury bills, real estate, invoices, money-market funds, and carbon credits.\\nAs part of the tokenisation process, something of value is captured with a token that resides on a blockchain and this token can be held in cryptocurrency wallets and utilised in decentralised applications (dApps).\\nWith tokenisation, RWAs could be transformed into digital assets that retain all the advantages of cryptocurrencies (e.g., public-key cryptography, transparency, traceability, and peer-to-peer transfers) whil\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Unlocking the Potential of RWA Real World Assets in Today's Economy\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.rwa.io/post/unlocking-the-potential-of-rwa-real-world-assets-in-today-s-economy\",\n    \"publishedDate\": \"2025-04-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"text\": \"## Latest Posts\\n\\nDive deeper into our latest articles, where we explore additional topics and innovations in the realm of digital asset tokenization.\\n\\n[View all](https://www.rwa.io/research)\\n\\nFeatured\\n\\nDecember 8, 2025\\n\\n[**AMM vs Order Book for RWA: Which Fits**](https://www.rwa.io/post/amm-vs-order-book-for-rwa-which-fits)\\n\\nAMM vs Order Book for RWA: Explore the core mechanics, architectures, and suitability of AMMs and order books for Real-World Asset tokenization.\\n\\n[Read more](https://www.rwa.io/post/amm-vs-order-book-for-rwa-which-fits)\\n\\nFeatured\\n\\nDecember 8, 2025\\n\\n[**Secondary Market for Tokenized Bonds: Venue Options**](https://www.rwa.io/post/secondary-market-for-tokenized-bonds-venue-options)\\n\\nExplore venue options for the secondary market for tokenized bonds, covering DEXs, CEXs, proprietary platforms, and emerging DeFi protocols.\\n\\n[Read more](https://www.rwa.io/post/secondary-market-for-tokenized-bonds-venue-options)\\n\\nFeatured\\n\\nDecember 7, 2025\\n\\n[**How Tokenization is Powering ESG Investments**](https://www.rwa.io/post/how-tokenization-is-powering-esg-investments)\\n\\nExplore how tokenization is revolutionizing ESG investing, from democratizing access to sustainable assets to enhancing transparency and compliance in green finance.\\n\\n[Read more](https://www.rwa.io/post/how-tokenization-is-powering-esg-investments)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"What Are Real-World Assets (RWA)?

BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo now operate production-scale platforms, with tokenized Treasuries at $7.5B and private credit at $14B. Key benefits: 24/7 trading, fractional ownership starting at $1,000, instant settlement, and 4-12% yields. The ecosystem spans Ethereum (59% share), ZKsync Era (private credit), and Solana (retail access). Industry projections: $16 trillion tokenized by 2030.\\n## What Are Real-World Assets (RWA)? The Financial Revolution Happening Right Now\\n**Quick answer:**Real-World Assets (RWAs) are traditional financial and physical assets represented as digital tokens on blockchain networks, enabling 24/7 global trading, fractional ownership, and programmable features impossible in conventional finance.\\nTraditional finance meets blockchain innovation as institutional assets migrate to programmable networks, creating unprecedented opportunities for global access, 24/7 trading, and automated financial services.
